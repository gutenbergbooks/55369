<p><span class="smcap">THE INDICTMENT&mdash;BRANDT AT COURT&mdash;THE ASSAULT ON THE
KING&mdash;THE KING'S DEPOSITION&mdash;THE QUEEN AND STRUENSEE&mdash;DUTY
OF A GOOD CITIZEN&mdash;THE CONFIDANT&mdash;THE ALLEGED

MODEST REQUEST&mdash;HURRIED PROCEEDINGS.</span></p></blockquote>


<p>On the same day that the Fiscal General Wiwet handed
in his indictment of Struensee, he delivered to the commission
his charges against Count Brandt, which were
to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p5">T<span class="smcap">HE</span> I<span class="smcap">NDICTMENT OF</span> C<span class="smcap">OUNT</span> B<span class="smcap">RANDT</span>.</p>

<p>As concerns the second principal prisoner, Count
Enevold Brandt, we cannot say of him that he undertook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
something which he did not understand, but he
has committed actions in which he ought not to have
allowed himself to be used.</p>

<p>I have already most submissively stated how he,
after being dismissed from court, again returned to it;
that it took place through the intercession of Count
Struensee, who required a person in whom he could
trust, who was bound to him, and who would neither
betray Struensee's enterprises, nor allow other persons
to betray them. It was his function, therefore, to pay
attention to everything that his royal Majesty undertook,
in word and in deed, and to prevent any one
having access to the king who did not belong to the
party.</p>

<p>The attendance of the valets was for this purpose
shortened. On the other hand, the king was to receive
every morning the visit of a doctor, who gave
him powders, although there was nothing the matter
with his Majesty, and, as valet Torp stated, lit. F.,
p. 52, his Majesty was just as healthy as he had been
before, and demanded no attendance from a doctor.</p>

<p>This doctor, Professor Berger, who, as the chosen
instrument of Counts Struensee and Brandt, there
can be no doubt indulged in thoughts about great
posts of honour to be acquired in Denmark, allowed
himself to be employed in incommoding his Majesty
every morning. The two other physicians in ordinary,
Etats-rath von Berger and Piper, could not be induced
to do such useless things; and hence we see
that Professor Berger did not go solely on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
his Majesty's health, but in order that the morning
hour might be spent with him, the confidant of the
counts.</p>

<p>It is not easy to understand how Count Brandt, of
whom it must be confessed that he possessed common
sense, and might have been useful to the king and
country as a native, allowed himself to be persuaded
to become a promoter of the Struensian undertakings.
Nor is it possible to discover what could induce him,
as a person of rank and family, to deny that <em>hauteur</em>
which is generally observed toward people of low
origin, unless it was caused by an unbounded desire
for honours and wealth, and that he consequently behaved
like those who consort with, and are the accomplices
of, thieves.</p>

<p>If Count Brandt, as he says and writes, wished to
leave the court and go on his travels, if only an income
of 1,000 dollars were allowed him, because he
saw that his remaining would do him no good, why
did he remain? Why did he not say to his Majesty
that he did not wish to stay at court any longer?
What Count Brandt alleges, therefore, is only a subterfuge;
and what he states in his memorials to Count
Struensee is not earnestness, but merely threats against
Count Struensee, who must effect that which Count
Brandt desired to attain, as is visible from the fact
that Count Struensee appears to have employed soothing
language. For if Count Brandt regarded his position
at court as a Hell (his own expression), he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
at liberty to get rid of it by sending in his resignation.
But it was not meant seriously. Hence he is not to
be excused for accepting a post of which himself says:&mdash;"Mais
je le force de vivre avec moi et pour comble
de disgrâce je suis encore obligé à le (the king) traiter
durement, à ce qu'il l'appelle pour qu'il ne devient
insolent vis-à-vis de la Reine, et si cela arrive par
hazard j'en porte la faute: cela tout seul est un Enfer."
In this position with his royal Majesty he has proved
himself guilty of the following capital crimes:&mdash;</p>


<p class="p5">I.</p>

<p>After free consideration and consultation he went in
to the king his master, and then challenged, abused,
attacked, beat, and bit his Majesty. This is certainly
unheard of, and, I must say of this deed, "animus
meminisse horret luctuque refugit." But it happened
so, and Count Brandt's own confession and the statements
of the witnesses confirm it.</p>

<p>Count Brandt confessed before the commission that
he&mdash;after his royal Majesty one day at breakfast had
said something which he, Count Brandt, considered insulting,
and his Majesty had thrown a lemon at him&mdash;consulted
with Count Struensee on the matter, who
advised him to go to the king and demand satisfaction.
In consequence of this, after laying a riding-whip
previously in a pianoforte standing in the king's ante-chamber,
in order to threaten the king with it, he went
into the king's cabinet, challenged, assaulted, and maltreated
him. (<em>V.</em> his confession, lit. F., pp. 309 and 322.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>This confession is confirmed by his Majesty's own
declaration to valet Schleel, who, on the morning after
the assault, came to his Majesty, and saw that the
king's neck was scratched; by the statements of valet
Brieghil, page of the bed-chamber Schack, valet Torp,
and also by the evidence of the negro boy Moranti.
From all this it is indisputably fully proved that
Count Brandt laid hands on his Majesty in order to
insult him&mdash;an awful deed, as King David says in the
second book of Samuel, chap, i., vv. 14, 15, 16:
"How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine
hand to destroy the Lord's anointed? * * * * Thy
blood be on thine own head."</p>

<p>It is true that Count Brandt has tried to excuse this
audacious deed, partly by the assurance that such
things were frequently done to his Majesty by Count
Holck and Warnstedt, partly by asserting that his
royal Majesty has forgiven him this crime. But even
if, as regards the first apology, we were to assume
for a moment that such audacious deeds were really
done by Count Holck and Von Warnstedt, this cannot
exculpate Count Brandt, who was not justified
in acting thus because another before him had committed
these crimes and escaped punishment. And as
regards the second excuse, his royal Majesty never
forgave him his crime, for the witnesses I have mentioned
declare, that after this occurrence his Majesty
could not endure Count Brandt, and was afraid of
being attacked by him; that his Majesty locked his
door on the following night, which was not usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the case, and thus revealed that his Majesty had not
forgiven Count Brandt the offence, and also that his
Majesty ordered page Schack<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to denounce Count
Brandt's treatment of him to this commission, which
would not have happened had the offence been
pardoned. Although such conduct toward a king can
never meet with an apology, still, if the assault had
been made at the moment when Count Brandt considered
himself insulted, and if it might appear that
he had undertaken it in an outburst of excitement, a
good deal might still be said against it. But in this
case, where he goes in to his king after reflection, and
in cold blood, orders out the persons present, so that
there may be no witnesses of the improper deed, locks
the door, in order that no one may afford assistance,
seizes the king round the neck, threatens him with
death; and when he at length lets him loose, after
the king has spoken soothingly, threatens him that
another time he shall not get off so cheaply; and, in
addition, abuses the king, as himself is obliged to
confess&mdash;nothing can be brought forward as the
slightest excuse for him; he is a child of death, and
one of the greatest criminals that ever trod the earth.
He has acted against his oath, which commands him
to risk his life and blood for his king and the defence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of his life; but exactly contrary to this oath he attacks
his king, and in such a way that the latter suffers a
loss of blood.</p>

<p>It is of no avail in his excuse that he alleges his
royal Majesty assaulted him first, unless this occurred
at a time when his Majesty was angry with him, and
he merely defended himself, which is human; but still
could not be permitted to any subject against his king.
But that he goes in to the king at a time when he had
no duties to perform, and only in order to say harsh
things to the king; that he goes in to terrify the king;
that he abuses him; that he defies the king,&mdash;all this
leaves him no other mode of escape but his statement,
that the king assaulted him first. But, in my opinion,
every man who suffers such treatment in his own house
has the right to regale a man with a cudgel who
comes into his room for the purpose of prostituting
him, and how much more so a king. If his Majesty
had killed him, Count Brandt, on the spot, it would
have been his well-merited reward, and could have
been answered before God and man.</p>

<p>As concerns Count Brandt's general behaviour toward
his royal Majesty; for instance, his going in to
the king in his <em>peignoir</em>, remaining with his Majesty
with his hat on, or entering the king's room while
playing the flute, this is really such conduct as no
master would put up with from his servant, much less
a king from his subject.</p>

<p>Count Brandt, it is true, apologises for all this by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
saying that his Majesty would have it so, and that
the same thing was done in the time of earlier servants
in an even more indifferent way. But the former is
only a proof of his Majesty's gentleness and kindness,
which do not like to express what a man ought to say
to himself, and the latter gives him no right; for must
I be a churl because my predecessor was one? In
this matter I could mention several instances of bad
conduct on the part of Count Brandt in treating his
royal Majesty contemptuously. But as the great
crime swallows up all the rest, it is unnecessary to
mention them here, and so make the trial longer.
<em>Crimine ab uno discimus omnia.</em></p>

<p>I will, therefore, now proceed to Count Brandt's
second capital offence.</p>


<p class="p5">II.</p>

<p>Count Brandt has broken the fidelity which he
owed to the king his master by virtue of the oath he
took to his Majesty, by being an accomplice in the
improper intercourse and intimacy which Count Struensee
had acquired with the person to whom he certainly
owed reverence and affection, but no tenderness.
Count Brandt confesses this, and that Count Struensee
confided it to him is proved by his, Brandt's, own confession,
lit. a, pp. 40 and 41. It is true that Count
Struensee, in his declaration, lit. a, p. 50, will not
quite admit Count Brandt's statement; but no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
can be possible when we remember that Count Brandt
was placed about his Majesty to prevent other persons
having access to the king, in order that Count Struensee
might have the better opportunity to play his
part. What could induce Count Struensee to share
the booty with him, and to allow him to rise in
honour equally with himself, unless it were done to
render him, Brandt, faithful, silent, and attentive?</p>

<p>That Count Brandt was cognizant of this illicit familiarity
is furthermore shown by Count Struensee's
reply to Count Brandt's letter, in which we read: "Je
n'ai partagé avec personne la confiance que je vous ai
donné: vous êtes le seul qui possède mes secrets, et à
qui je m'explique sur tous les objets sans reserve."
Count Brandt, generally as a subject, and specially as
a royal official, Danish count and chamberlain, was
commanded by the law to promote the king's welfare
and prevent his detriment by his utmost efforts.
Hence two duties were offered him: either to reveal
the affair to the king, or to observe to the guilty party
that such things must not be allowed; to oppose such
a disgusting life, and threaten to reveal it to the king.
I fancy I can hear a sincere friend of the king and of
the honour of the royal family speaking thus to Count
Struensee: "Audacious traitor and most impudent of
the human race! you who ought to recognise and
honour the supremacy and majesty, turn back from
your impudence, and know that I, even through my
birth, am bound to avert everything that entails the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
dishonour of the house of the king and his family."
I believe that such language would have had more
effect than all the memoirs. But, unhappily, money
flowed, which Count Brandt needed; and hence he
did not dare say, "May you be damned with your
money!" I certainly see that I may be answered:
"Why did not others do so? Why did the Fiscal
General himself neglect it?" But to this it may be
answered: "No one knew so much about it as Count
Brandt. No one was so near the king as he; he kept
every one away from the king, for the purpose that
his royal Majesty might learn nothing about it from
one or the other." But it was his duty, as he was
always about the king, and was accurately acquainted
with everything. If he were, on the contrary, to object
that such matters did not concern him, although
he is forced to confess having warned Count Struensee
of what happened to them both on January 17, still
he could have learned from Councillor of Chancery
Blechinberg and his wife, and Mesdames Schiötte and
Buch, what his duty was, and what he ought to have
done. But as he not only omitted to do this, but did
everything that lay in his power to prevent the affair
reaching the king, and as Count Struensee has been
found guilty in this matter of an assault on the king's
supremacy, Count Brandt must be regarded as an accomplice,
and punished in accordance with the paragraph
of the law 6&mdash;4&mdash;14.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>


<p class="p5">III.</p>

<p>In the same way as Count Brandt displayed faithlessness
toward his king in the previous point, he
furthermore showed it in the following affair, by
joining Count Struensee in robbing the royal treasury
of various sums of money.</p>

<p>It is an easy matter for a person who is daily with
his king, and in such a manner that no one else can
reach him, to grow rich. But such an enterprise cannot
be so easily excused, even if there be the king's
assent to it, for the king's favour must be as little
abused in money matters as in other things. To
pocket a sum of 60,000 dollars for so short a period
of service, because he annoyed the king, and waited
on him, not to his comfort, but to his vexation and
that of others, seems to denote audacity and impudence
as well as slight reflection. To appropriate so
large a sum in so short a time, while the land was
sunk in debt, and seventy thousand human beings
must contribute to it from their poverty, and save it
out of their food, was not a wise action on the part
of a man who wished to be regarded as a patriot. But
his royal Majesty did not give Count Brandt any such
sum; but Count Struensee procured it for him by converting
6,000 dollars into 60,000.</p>

<p>I produce here the questions laid before Count
Brandt in respect to this matter, and his answers.
From these we learn that Count Brandt declares he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
first received 10,000 dollars and afterwards 60,000,
although he alleges it was only 50,000, and lastly, at
the new year, in addition to 300 dollars, 3,000 more.</p>

<p>Count Brandt is obliged himself to confess that there
appears to him something strange and very suspicious
in the document in which credit is taken for the 60,000
dollars, and which I have discussed more amply in the
indictment of Count Struensee. Count Brandt does
not deny having received the money, and that he gave
no receipt for it, but thanked the king for it, though
without mentioning the amount. If we now take into
consideration what I said about this in my accusation
against Count Struensee, not the slightest doubt can
exist that Count Brandt was an accomplice in this
audacious deed, and therefore was guilty of the crime
of forgery.</p>

<p>These are the principal crimes of Count Brandt as
regards his own person. In addition, he took part in all
the crimes which Count Struensee committed; he had
confidants and instruments to set in work everything
that Count Struensee wished, instead of acting in accordance
with his oath and his duty, and avoiding those
things which he knew would have evil results. I may be
permitted to regard it as superfluous to enter more fully
into these matters, as they are well known to the exalted
commission, and I have sufficient proofs for my
proposed sentence, which I most submissively offer for
decision in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That Count Chamberlain Enevold Brandt, who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
not only forgotten the most submissive veneration
which he owed to the king his master, but also had
the audacity to go into the king's cabinet, and then
not only address his supreme royal Majesty in bad
language, but also to commit the most audacious and
unheard-of deed of laying hands on his lord the king,
the anointed of God, as an insult to his royal Majesty,
as well as behaved in many points unfaithfully
to his Majesty, and consented to many things against
his better knowledge, although his royal Majesty had
shown him great favour,&mdash;be condemned by virtue of
the paragraphs of the law 6&mdash;4&mdash;1&mdash;14, to forfeit his
dignity as count and his office of chamberlain as well
as his honour, life and estate; that after his coat of
arms has been broken by the executioner, his right
hand shall be cut off while alive, the body quartered
and exposed on the wheel, his head and hands affixed
to a pole, his fortune confiscated to the king, and his
heirs, should he possess any, lose their rank and name."</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>April</em> 21, 1772. <span class="rightlinea">F. W. W<span class="smcap">IWET</span>.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As regards Brandt's confession of a knowledge of
the familiarity between the queen and Struensee, it is
probable that Brandt was persuaded that his life depended
on what he might say about the <em>liaison</em>. What
other motive could he have had for making such a confession?
If Brandt had merely declared, like Berger
and others, that he had suspicions on the subject, it
would have been of no use. Something positive being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
required, he declared that he was informed of it. How
could he be so? Was it by Struensee, who concealed
nothing from him?</p>

<p>But Struensee, instead of acknowledging this confidence,
absolutely denied it, and no confrontation was
ventured. Again, if Brandt's declaration was correct,
why did Struensee repulse it so loudly? It appears
indisputable that he did so because it was false.</p>

<p>And the position in which Brandt placed himself by
yielding to the solicitations of the commissioners was
very probably the cause of his ruin. The mysteries
of this trial must be buried with him. Without this
motive, what interest could there have been in destroying
a man like Brandt? Was there a shadow of justice
in condemning him to death for things which
were quite common with the king?</p>

<p>Two days after this wretched indictment, which was
merely handed in to the commission as a matter of
form, the defence was delivered by Advocate Bang to
the same judges, and was to the following effect:&mdash;</p>


<p class="p5">B<span class="smcap">ANG'S</span> D<span class="smcap">EFENCE OF</span> C<span class="smcap">OUNT</span> B<span class="smcap">RANDT</span>.</p>

<p>By the most gracious commands of his royal
Majesty, of March 23, which are attached to this
under lit. <span class="smcap">A</span>, I shall lay before this high commission
Count Brandt's defence&mdash;not the defence of the
actions of which he is accused, but his defence in so
far as the accusations are incorrect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>It must reasonably insult Count Brandt to find that
he whom his Majesty, through his own special favour,
and as a reward for his faithful services to his king
and master, raised to the rank of Count, selected for
his daily intimate society, and honoured with many
superfluous proofs of favour and confidence,&mdash;that he,
I say, should see himself condemned to lose his dignity
of count, his honour, life, and fortune, and have his
body ill-treated by the executioner. But, according
to his own declaration, made to me, his defender,
neither his death, his disgrace, nor his torture, will be
so painful to him as the sole idea that he has failed in
the most submissive reverence, willingness, devotion,
and fidelity, which his duty to his king and benefactor
commanded, and by which he would have descended
below humanity, and, so to speak, have borrowed a
model of his actions from the evil spirits. If his
conscience reproached him on these points, the bodily
punishments would be no torture as compared with
this grief; but he has, with a calm conscience, and
unassailed by its gnawings, listened to the charges
brought against him, and requested me to bring
forward the following in his defence:&mdash;</p>


<p class="p5"><em>Ad Præliminaria.</em></p>

<p>The Fiscal General accuses Count Brandt (<em>a</em>) that
by Count Struensee's regulation, and in <em>liaison</em> with
him, he was employed at court after his foreign tour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
so that Count Struensee might have in him a man in
whom he could trust, who would neither betray his
designs, nor allow any one else to reveal them; (<em>b</em>)
that Count Brandt kept people from the king who did
not belong to the party; (<em>c</em>) that he shortened the
attendance of the valets on the king's person, and,
instead of it, arranged that Professor Berger, contrary
to the king's wish, should wait on his Majesty
in the mornings for the purpose of giving him powders,
which were innocent, however; and (<em>d</em>) that he
compelled the king to live with him, and treated him
harshly.</p>

<p>Count Brandt has never regarded it as a crime to
have allowed himself to be recommended to his
Majesty by the man to whom the king granted his
favour and confidence. What he attained through
Struensee's recommendation was only a continuation
of what Privy Councillors Saldern and Bernstorff had
begun. The aforesaid post was neither given him to
keep things secret, nor to conceal from the king
things which, according to the Fiscal General's
opinion, his Majesty must not be allowed to know.
As it is not specially mentioned what the things were
which must be concealed from the king, while the
counsel only appears to refer to that which is alleged
under the third chief point, I will reserve my special
reply to it, and here content myself with offering a
general denial to the general statement. I do not
know what sort of party it was of which the Fiscal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
General speaks when he says that Count Brandt prevented
persons having access to the king who were
not useful to the party. He probably supposes a
party which was opposed to the king or the welfare of
the country; but as he does not state of what persons
the assumed party was composed, the nature of their
actions, what designs they entertained, or by what
means they were to be realised, I am here dispensed
from the obligation of answering this specially, and
can content myself with the remark that there was no
such party hostile to the king and country so far as
came to Count Brandt's knowledge. He certainly
had the permission to be near the king's person, but
had neither the power nor the wish to keep any one
away from his Majesty; and the Fiscal General has
not been able to mention a single person of sufficient
dignity to have access to the king, and who was refused
it by Count Brandt. I must remark here that
the king was lord and master, and had merely to
command by a sign who was to come and who to go,
and how long each was to remain, in which Count
Brandt never opposed the king's will.</p>

<p>Had the king wished that the valets should remain
longer with his Majesty, Count Brandt would not
have prevented him; and this charge can the less be
brought against him, as it can be seen from valet
Schleel's evidence, how it had been ordered long
before that not the valet, but Von Warnstedt, who
formerly occupied Count Brandt's post, should dress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and undress the king; and after Count Brandt, the
black boys were ordered to perform this duty.
Equally little can Professor Berger's morning visits be
brought as a charge against Count Brandt, even if
they had had evil consequences; while, on the contrary,
the powders which the king took did not impair
his health. Berger paid these visits so long as the
king was willing to accept them; but when his Majesty
no longer desired them, Berger kept away.</p>

<p>The words in Count Brandt's letter to Count
Struensee, which the Fiscal General treats as a crime,
have been so fully explained by Count Brandt's reply
to questions 92 and 93, p. 120 of the examination,
that I have nothing to add but refer to it, and this
explanation deprives that passage in the letter of all
the harshness which might otherwise be found in it.
With what right Count Brandt could be accused of
having an understanding with Count Struensee, and
of striving to sustain him, is proved by his explanation
to questions 64, 65, and 68 of the examination,
in which he gives a full account how he had resolved
to overthrow Count Struensee, from the time when he
perceived the encroachments of the latter; that he consulted
with Count von der Osten about this operation,
by which Count Struensee was to be placed under
arrest at Kronborg&mdash;a proposal which was not carried
into effect, solely through an earlier, riper, and more
successful interruption. As regards this disposition,
the count has appealed to the testimony of Privy
Councillor von der Osten, and I am convinced that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
this statement of Count Brandt has been imparted to
his excellency, who has not disavowed it. Count
Brandt's letter to Struensee, and the answer of the
latter, which have been produced by the Fiscal
General, prove how little desire Count Brandt had to
enter into Count Struensee's views; that his whole
conduct and thought was to surrender the post which
he occupied, and to be allowed to quit the court.
There is further evidence of this in the fact that when
Count Struensee offered him the ministerial post of
Privy Councillor von der Osten, he refused it, and
preferred retirement from court to this pleasant office.
All this destroys the charges which the Fiscal General
has alleged in the preliminary part of his indictment
of Count Brandt.</p>


<p class="p5"><em>Ad possum 1mum.</em></p>

<p>"According to the Fiscal General, Count Brandt,
of his free will, and after due reflection, went in to his
master the king and challenged, abused, attacked, and
bit him."</p>

<p>If Count Brandt performed this execrable deed in
the way the Fiscal General represents it, his righteous
king would not have hesitated a moment to have had
him thrown into fetters, and given him his well-merited
reward&mdash;the hardest death. His Majesty, however
after this event is stated to have occurred, namely, at
the end of September, for several months admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
him to his presence as before, and granted him his
most gracious daily intercourse, which satisfactorily
proves that his royal Majesty did not regard the aforesaid
occurrence as criminal.</p>

<p>Count Brandt, for his part, equally little regarded
it as audacious, either when the affair occurred, or
afterwards. For, just as he described it, in its full
details, in presence of the commission, when nothing
could induce him to do so but the innocence which,
according to his opinion, lay in the whole affair, if the
circumstances connected with it were taken into consideration
in the same way, his open confession proves
the confidence he placed in his innocence, as the affair
could not be proved by witnesses; and the man who
knows himself to be innocent is never criminal. This
confession of Count Brandt, therefore, must, as the
sole existing proof in the affair, be registered as credible,
just as well in those passages where it speaks
for his acquittal as where it serves to testify against
him.</p>

<p>From this deposition, which perfectly agrees with
Count Struensee's statement before the commission
on March 21, we see what in this strange affair speaks
in Count Brandt's defence. We must, therefore,
regard in the first instance the peculiar circumstance
that his Majesty the King, for the sake of enjoying the
pleasures of private intercourse, as people of equal
rank carry it on together&mdash;although the "sweetness"
of such intercourse usually shuns thrones&mdash;commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
that the man whom he selected as his intimate
should not consort with him as the king, but as his
equal, or as one friend with the other. If Count
Brandt, through submissive respect, addressed him
differently, the king answered sarcastically, "Most
submissive knave," in order to remind him of the
commands which had been given, that Count Brandt
in daily intercourse should forget he was the king,
just as one of his Majesty's ancestors, of most revered
memory used to act, and at times remarked, "Now
the king is not at home;" and, again, when the free
conversation was to have an end, "The king is at home
again now."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But his present Majesty never would
be at home, so to speak, for the man he had admitted
to his intimacy, but demanded equality.</p>

<p>From those men selected for his constant society,
the king demanded what is understood by the term
<em>un homme fait</em>, that they should be smart fellows, and
before all, have their heart in the right place, of which
they must furnish a proof if he desired it, and he
could not on any terms endure cowards, because such
disgusted his heroic nature. As now his Majesty had
seen no proof of this good quality from Count Brandt,
not even after many inducements had been given,
because Count Brandt always held back, his Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
most effectually forced them from him by threatening
to cudgel him in the presence of the queen, Struensee,
and other persons. Count Brandt, who regarded
this as a real sign of the king's disfavour, fell
into a state of desperation about it, until he was informed
by Struensee, who had spoken with the king
on the subject, that his Majesty's wishes and most
gracious intentions were only directed to obtain a
proof of Brandt's courage. It was for this reason that
Count Brandt one evening, without feeling the slightest
anger, went into the king, and, after ordering out
the lad, who was not to witness the sport, stated to
the king that he had been told by Count Struensee
that his Majesty wished him to prove himself a man
of courage, and to do so against the king. His Majesty,
far from being offended at such a scene on the part of
Count Brandt, "admitted" him, in accordance with
his given order, at once to a fight, and the king himself
made the first five or six attacks. This would
have assuredly taken a very different course if the
king had regarded it as an insult. On this occasion,
his Majesty involuntarily thrust a finger into Count
Brandt's mouth, which the latter quite as innocently
seized with his teeth. The defence followed the attack:
the king demanded of Count Brandt, <em>presta te
virum</em>. Upon this Count Brandt seized the king by
the coat, thrust him against the wall, and thus proved
that he was stronger than the king; and with this the
whole affair ended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Count Brandt persistently denies having beaten the
king, or audaciously raised his hand against his Majesty;
he only proved himself to be strong and brave,
without seriousness or passion, by his Majesty's commands.
His Majesty's own most gracious conduct to
Count Brandt also proves that everything passed off
without anger and annoyance, as his Majesty showed
the count the signal favour of kissing him on the spot,
and requesting him to remain and kill the time with
conversation, which Count Brandt did by the king's
orders, and all of which points to the disposition of
their minds, and proves that they were not excited, as
is also confirmed by Count Struensee's statement in
the examination of March 21, that Count Brandt,
when he went in to the king, was not at all irritated,
but perfectly calm. After this time his Majesty also
promoted him to be <em>grand maître de la garderobe</em>,
and carried on his confidential intercourse with him
for several months as before, all of which speaks for
the nature of this affair. In Count Brandt's heart
reigned no bitterness against the king, and no contempt:
trembling from veneration, he performed the
action which he would have regarded as audacious,
had it not been for the king's command. It is true
that Count Brandt, a few days previously, laid a riding
whip upon a pianoforte standing in the king's ante-chamber,
but only did so thoughtlessly, which he
afterwards regretted, and as ill-deeds consist in actions
carried out but not in inconsiderate designs, this occur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>rence
cannot be reckoned as a crime on the part of
Count Brandt.</p>

<p>If Count Brandt employed some expressions against
the king which, according to the strict letter, would
be highly criminal, he only employed them in the tone
of all the rest, and consequently only in jest. I pass
over the statements of the witnesses examined, as
these people neither heard nor saw the occurrence,
but only testify what they heard said about it. On
the other hand, the declaration which his Majesty laid
before the commission, through his page of the chamber
Schack, is of the extremest importance. I read
it to Count Brandt, and he has requested me to make
the following explanation about it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He did not remember this 'passage' in the way
that it flowed from the page's lips: he considers himself
too insignificant to contradict a declaration which
emanated from the king his master, and only emboldens
himself in dust and fetters to mention, that if
his Majesty were most graciously disposed to take this
affair seriously, as the declaration made by page of the
chamber Schack appears to intimate, he regards himself
as lost, and will not from this moment attempt
any further justification, but will at once throw himself
at his Majesty's feet, and seek his salvation in the
king's clemency; but in the most submissive confidence
in his Majesty's mercy, he would venture most humbly
to remind him of the circumstances already mentioned."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>As concerns the charge which the Fiscal General
derives from the fact that Count Brandt at times went
to the king playing the flute, and with his hat on his
head, and also in his <em>peignoir</em>, Count Brandt acknowledges
that this did occur when he returned from the
chase and was heated, but that it was not done through
contempt of the king, but because his Majesty preferred
such conduct, and never evinced any anger at
it. He also dared to appear before the king in his
<em>peignoir</em>, which consisted of a cloth surtout, because it
was his Majesty's wish that he should come in the
dress he was wearing when the king summoned him.</p>


<p class="p5"><em>Ad passum</em> 2<em>dum</em>.</p>

<p>"That Count Brandt did not reveal to the king the
improper intercourse which is said to have taken place
between the queen and Struensee, by which he has
rendered himself guilty of the punishment which the
law dictates for this in 6&mdash;4&mdash;14."</p>

<p>Although Count Brandt felt morally convinced of
this improper intercourse between the queen and Count
Struensee, still he possessed no juridical proof of it,
much less such proofs as he could at once have produced
in his defence against the denial of the guilty
parties. And what might Count Brandt have reasonably
expected if he had alleged such a crime against a
reigning queen, who at that time possessed the king's
heart, which would have disturbed the king, shamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the queen, and dishonoured the royal house? In that
case, 6&mdash;4&mdash;1 of the law would have been proper for
him, even if he could have proved his denunciation instantly.
If, for his own part, he could have proved this
crime with his life, he would, probably, not have spared
his life. Things, however, under the circumstances,
remained as they were. Count Brandt would have
been a ruined man, without amending the business;
and if such a sort of silence were a neck-breaking
crime, only few persons in the country would retain
their heads.</p>


<p class="p5"><em>Ad passum</em> 3<em>tium</em>.</p>

<p>"That Count Brandt has been guilty of the crime
of forgery."</p>

<p>Whatever forgery Count Struensee may have committed,
it does not affect Count Brandt. Even if
Count Struensee may have converted the sum of 6,000
dollars, approved by the king into 60,000, Count
Brandt knows nothing about it. Count Brandt has
not acknowledged this, and it has not been proved
against him, nor did he receive 60,000 dollars all at
once; but, on one occasion, 10,000 dollars, for which
the king's note is still in existence; and the other
50,000 dollars were paid him by Baron Schimmelmann,
and, according to Count Struensee's statement,
were a present to him from the king. Count Brandt
thanked the king for this, who answered him, "It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
but fair he should give him a <em>douceur</em>, as he was always
with him." Count Brandt never asked for this sum,
and if it was given him by the king, he could not refuse
it, the less so as, through his daily intercourse with
the royal family, he was compelled to play high, in
which he lost considerable sums. Count Brandt even
declared on this occasion that if the king were indisposed
to grant such large sums, he was ready to give
the money back.</p>

<p>From all this I believe I have proved that the
crimes alleged against Count Brandt are exaggerated.
I must therefore most submissively request that Count
Enevold Brandt may be acquitted from the accusation
of the Fiscal General.</p>

<p>In all the rest he submits himself to the clemency
of his most gracious king.</p>

<p>So little did Brandt comprehend the danger of his
position, that he sent to the judges the following letter,
in which, as Reverdil justly remarks, the Don Quixotism,
levity, and inconsequence of his character are displayed
in a manner which would be ridiculous under
any other circumstances:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<em>Pro Memoriâ.</em>"</p>

<p>I send you, my judges, a letter to his Majesty,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and
leave it to you, when you have read it and this pro
memoriâ, whether you will then think proper to have
it delivered to the king or not. What I now write to
you is in the same manner no document which I wish
to be placed with the rest, or to be regarded as if it belonged
to my trial.</p>

<p>The letter to the king is rather badly written, but
the pens given me were very bad. I beg the king's
forgiveness, as I now know that in all cases, none excepted,
it is the duty of a subject to humiliate himself
before his monarch. Previously a flashing sword
would not have brought me to do so.</p>

<p>My letter could be more imploring and submissive,
but I did not believe that this would please his Majesty.
I employ the expression which the king so
frequently used: "That no one knew so much about
his affairs as I did." This he was accustomed to say
to me when he was in a good temper, and I hope thus
to recall his thoughts. He often added, that no one bore
such a resemblance to him as myself; but I have
omitted this expression, as the words would be too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
bold. I should prefer that this letter should be read
to the king at a favourable moment, than that he
should read it first himself.</p>

<p>I find it natural that a double doubt will arise with
you, my judges, and with all to whom you may show
this letter:</p>

<p>(1) Does Brandt deserve, from the nature of the
affair, that the king should pardon him fully? and</p>

<p>(2) What more does he want?</p>

<p>With the same frankness with which I have explained
myself during the whole of my trial, I can
assert, that you would at once feel the heartiest compassion,
if it were feasible to bring my affair entirely
to light, partly by summoning fresh witnesses, partly
by cross-examining those who have been heard: but I
do not wish this, even though it might cost me life and
liberty. I will only mention a few slight but important
circumstances, which might induce you to believe
that I must feel a bitterness against the king:</p>

<p>(1) That I am said to have bitten the king's finger.
My statement proves that I did not hear of it till afterwards.
Consequently, it was not done <em>animo nocendi</em>,
but was a natural movement for a man to close his
mouth when his tongue was caught hold of, and as
soon as I perceived it, I asked for pardon. The king
tapped me on the cheek, and said: "It does not hurt."</p>

<p>(2) I myself mentioned that I laid a riding whip
on the pianoforte, with the intention of taking it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
with me to the king: but could that have been known
without my frankness? and woe to us, if every thought
were to be punished!</p>

<p>(3) On this occasion I employed improper language
to the king, although not that of which I am accused:
but in the melancholy alternative of displaying
my courage either in words or deeds, I chose the
former.</p>

<p>(4) An important circumstance, which rendered a
proof of such courage rather necessary, was that the
king often said: "If I was certain you were a coward,
I would post myself behind the door and kill you."</p>

<p>(5) But why was the king so angry? Solely because,
from that time, I was more serious and submissive than
before, which I did to render the king more reserved,
but which had the effect that he supposed I disliked
him; and a temper, which has been once rendered captious,
soon places the worst construction upon everything.</p>

<p>(6) I declare before God, who knows my heart,
that a similar scene never occurred before or afterwards.
The king once threw his glove in my face:
I stooped, picked it up, and said: "Why do you do
that? I am really not cross with you;" and with this
he was satisfied.</p>

<p>(7) That I never regarded this occurrence as anything
but a joke, the result of youth and eccentricity,
is seen from the fact that when the commission began
sitting, I was not aware of my offence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>In this way I believe I have answered all doubts.
I am quite ready to die, and to endure all the punishments
that are imposed upon me. It is God's chastening
hand, which I have deserved: but I consider it
my duty to speak this once.</p>

<p>His Majesty was angry with me: hence, I was imprisoned;
hence, I was put in fetters. I can offer no
objection to this: I kiss the hand that smites me, but
the hand which smites me can also let loose and forgive,
in the same way as Henri IV. frequently forgave
much greater offences. Even should you consider
that this is too great mercy, and if you wish that
I should humiliate myself, personally, before his Majesty,
I should not regard such a thing at all as
a disgrace.</p>

<p>Oh! my judges, if you would only see what my
situation with the king was! and would you could feel
as greatly, but forget quite as quickly, what my present
position is! Your eyes would assuredly shed tears,
and your hearts would be moved by the sincerest
compassion! I commend my cause to the hands of
God, and beg you for what I have no occasion to beg,
namely, to follow your own convictions: with that I
shall be perfectly satisfied.</p>

<p>In the letter to his Majesty, I have begged to be
allowed to pass my days in peace, and by that I mean
a bailiwick in a remote province. I do not know
whether such a post is vacant, of which I might entertain
hopes, but I know that Bailiff Arnholdt, of Bram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>stedt<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
(in Holstein) has long wished himself away
from there, and that this post is one of the worst.
Further my wishes do not extend, and what right
could I have to ask!</p>

<p>The drama of the great trial rapidly approached the
catastrophe after the charges against Struensee and
Brandt were delivered to the commissioners on
April 21. Struensee's defence followed on the 22nd;
the Fiscal General's reply and Brandt's defence on
the 23rd; and so early as the 25th the sentences were
promulgated. In Brandt's trial a reply was not even
considered necessary, for the accuser had announced
this to be superfluous in his sentence, <em>ab uno discimus
omnia</em>. But the orders from the highest quarters
were for the greatest possible speed, and the length of
the sentence proves that it had been drawn up beforehand.
That two human lives were at stake, was only
so far taken into consideration as it was necessary
to prove two judicial murders justifiable by every
resource of sophistry; but how little the venal judges
succeeded in doing so, will be seen from a perusal of
the memorable documents which are here published

<p>Apart from the fact that Count John Frederick
Struensee has already been convicted, and has himself
confessed that he has committed a terrible crime,
which involves in an eminent degree an assault on
the king's supremacy, or the crime of high treason, and
according to the law (especially art. 1 of cap. iv. of
book vi.) deserves the severe penalty of death; it is
sufficiently notorious and proven that his whole
conduct and management during the time when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
had a share in the administration of the affairs was a
chain, which, on one side, was composed of vain and
audacious impetuosity; on the other, of tricks and
intrigues, all of which operated to secure him the whole
power and authority to the exclusion of others. At
the same time he boldly employed all the measures
which appeared to be useful in attaining his ends,
without in the slightest degree reflecting whether
they were permitted or not, and how far they
accorded with the form of government and the constitution,
the genius of the nation and the regulations
and laws, both civil and fundamental, or were in
strict opposition to them.</p>

<p>His great design was partly to become privy
cabinet minister, with the extraordinary and unparalleled
authority which he filched in the last month of
July, partly to exclude all the subjects from their
king, and the king from them; partly to exercise at
court and over his Majesty such an unbridled power
as has been seen with astonishment.</p>

<p>In order to attain this end, he strove, during his
Majesty's foreign journey, to gain his most gracious
favour by proved care for the king's health and
pleasure. When his Majesty returned, Struensee
behaved quietly, and seemed to think of nothing less
than the attachment of charges and honours, although
his ambition and his love of power desired them.</p>

<p>He lived at court, amused himself, demanded no
increase of his salary, and seemed to satisfy himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
with peace and voluptuousness; but in secret he
zealously strove to lay the foundation on which he
intended to raise his proud fortune.</p>

<p>It was not his business to learn the language of the
country, to study the position and true interest of the
kingdom, and to learn its civil laws and constitution.
This was the way which he ought to have chosen;
but about all these things he was, and remained, in the
deepest ignorance. Instead of this, he preferred to
establish the principles which his Majesty should
follow in the government, so that he might use them
in concealing his infamous propositions behind them,
and as he had every reason to apprehend that either
faithfully minded men might reveal his designs, or
that the king himself should detect them; in order to
prevent the former effect, he calumniated without
distinction all those who had the honour of being
allowed to approach the monarch, and in order to
secure the latter, he strove to acquire a powerful
protection, and to have in the king's neighbourhood
so close, constant, and trustworthy a friend, that it was
rendered almost impossible for his Majesty to penetrate
this man's ways and designs.</p>

<p>No sooner had he got his machine in perfect readiness
in the year 1770 than he at once set it in motion.</p>

<p>Since the sovereignty our kings have had a council,
composed of men who were experienced in the laws
and customs of the country, and had studied the true
state-system and real interests of the land, while, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the same time, they knew the rules which were applicable
in cases that occurred.</p>

<p>It was their office to attend the king, as often as
matters of importance were to be laid before him, in
order to afford his Majesty the necessary explanations
about everything he wished to know, so that he might
give his decision.</p>

<p>These men, however, as members of the council,
had no vote, no expedition, no secretaries; for everything
depended on the king's will, and everything was
carried into effect by the departments concerned.</p>

<p>This traditional and so natural council Struensee
and his adherents<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> wished to have entirely abolished
and quashed, for this man apprehended that if such a
council existed, and even if it were composed of his
own friends, the time would arrive when it would
oppose his injurious propositions, and reveal them to
the king, as he could not exclude them (the members)
from speaking with his Majesty, and representing to
him what was best for him and the land.</p>

<p>For this end Struensee had previously calumniated
the ministry by all sorts of insinuations, and even
depicted in the blackest colours those of their actions
which were evidently to the advantage of the king
and the state.</p>

<p>His Majesty the king, who heartily loves his people,
only desires honest officials, and jealously holds to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
sovereign power, now lost his confidence in the
council, wished to appoint other men to it, and to give
it a different constitution; but Struensee, by false statements,
and the most cunning tricks, laid such obstacles
in the king's way that the council gradually ceased to
meet, and was finally solemnly abolished by a decree
of December 27, 1770.</p>

<p>At the same time, he became <em>maître des requêtes</em>,
and as it was his plan that only he should have the
right to speak to the king about the affairs, and that
all other persons should be excluded from doing so,
it appeared to him that the remaining colleges might
still lay some impediments in his way.</p>

<p>In order to prevent this, he represented to his
Majesty the King, who wished to be thoroughly acquainted
with the affairs sent in from the colleges for
his most gracious decision, that nothing would be more
useful for this object than for the colleges to be ordered
to deliver their written requests in a portfolio, so that
the king might be allowed the requisite time to read
through the memoirs and reflect.</p>

<p>By this brilliant, and apparently so useful advice,
this man gained his object of also "excluding" the
colleges from the king.</p>

<p>He soon seizes the portfolios, and thus becomes the
sole master to lay matters before the king at his pleasure.</p>

<p>If the colleges wished to produce further reasons
for the king's better information, they must apply to
Struensee, and thus he alone became what the council
and the colleges together had formerly been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the pretext of a more rapid expedition of
various matters, and in order to display the royal
authority in its right supremacy, he issued cabinet
decrees, which were carried out without the colleges
concerned being informed of them,&mdash;a conduct which
necessarily produced the greatest confusion, and which
a man dared, who was neither acquainted with the
country nor its laws, its condition nor its language.
But this did not trouble him at all, so long as he could
grasp all the respect and all the power.</p>

<p>This ignorance of Count Struensee in everything,
which every minister in Denmark must know, and his
extremely slight efforts to obtain a knowledge of it,
entailed innumerable disadvantages, both generally and
for private persons.</p>

<p>In the colleges, which were formerly accustomed to
send in their reports in Danish, a special official had
to be appointed to translate them into German, so that
Count Struensee might read them in this language.
The Danish Chancery, the only college which continued
to report in Danish, had only too often opportunity
for learning that these representations were not
read at all, as only an extract of the proposition, which,
by command, was inserted in what was called the
Rotulus, was translated into German and seen by
Count Struensee, after which the resolution ensued in
the German language, and was again translated into
Danish in the Chancery. It could not fail but that
the resolution often proved equivocal, incomprehen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>sible,
and but little adapted to the affair, of which the
man who represented it to his Majesty had only rarely
a correct idea.</p>

<p>Private persons who wished to send in petitions to
the cabinet, and had drawn them up in the Danish
language, ran about to find a German translator, as
they were of the possibly not incorrect opinion that
their memorial, if such was only in Danish, would not
be read, while these cheap translations often turned
out so, that it was impossible to discern what was the
real object of the petition.</p>

<p>Count Struensee's ignorance of the organization of
the colleges, his unwillingness to instruct himself
about it, and his exertions to reform the entire old state
constitution, and to increase the number of his adherents
by appointing persons everywhere, and to the
highest offices, who owed their fortune to him&mdash;all
this led him to lay hands on one college after the
other. And as he would not and could not work
himself, he employed other men in carrying out the
important reforms, several of whom afterwards confessed
that they had no knowledge of the advantages
and defects of the former organization of these colleges,
nor attempted to acquire it, as they were only
ordered to draw up a plan of the new arrangements
after a certain predetermined date.</p>

<p>After Count Struensee had drawn all power and
authority into his own hands by removing the privy
council, by weakening and reconstituting, and by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
exclusion of verbal reports, it was not long ere his
Majesty's subjects perceived the effects of his, Struensee's,
despotic principles and ideas.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the before-mentioned paternal
and mild government, to which people had been long
accustomed in Denmark, and which had to some
extent acquired a traditional right, every one who
had obtained a royal appointment considered himself
justified in believing that he should retain it so long as
he behaved himself properly and attended to his duties,
and therefore ran no risk of losing his post against
his will, so long as he was not declared unworthy of
it through a judicial sentence on account of malversation,
errors, or negligence. These moderate principles,
which characterised the mildness of the government,
and had many excellent results, were not at all
to Count Struensee's taste, who did not wish to be in
the least degree impeded when the object was to ruin
people, and imbue others with terror.</p>

<p>For this reason it was heard frequently, nay, almost
daily, that first one, then the other, royal official was
removed by a cabinet order, without their learning
what error they had committed, or in what their
offence consisted.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Several persons also lost their posts without any
royal resolution on the subject being imparted to
them, and without knowing anything of it, till they
learned that their office had been given to another
man by a cabinet order. This conduct was even extended
to the dismissal of entire colleges.</p>

<p>The entire magistracy, consisting of from eighteen
to twenty, or even more persons, was abolished, and
a new magistracy was appointed by a cabinet order
addressed on April 3, 1771, to the president, who had
been appointed to this post only a few days previously,
and also by a cabinet decree, and who contented himself
with informing the previous members of the magistracy
by letter that they were dismissed, and the new
ones that they were to assemble at the town-hall
without the deposed members learning what offence
they had committed, or why they were discharged.</p>

<p>In addition to the magistracy, there was another
college or public assembly in Copenhagen, namely, the
so-called thirty-two men, as, owing to the bravery and
fidelity so solemnly displayed by the Copenhageners
during the siege, and on the establishment of the
sovereignty,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> it was conceded among the privileges
granted to the citizens on June 24, 1664, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
should be allowed to elect thirty-two of the best and
most respected citizens, who would, with the magistracy,
consult about the welfare of the city, and its
revenues and out-goings. In these privileges access to
his Majesty's person was also granted to the city
deputies and the magistracy.</p>

<p>This assembly, which was regarded as the highest of
these privileges, and had had many good results, and,
moreover, did not cost the king or city a farthing, was
also dissolved by the aforesaid cabinet order, by virtue
of which the chief president informed the men that
they were no longer permitted to meet, and ordered
the council-hall to be closed. This, and many other
instances of a similar nature, which all proved that
nothing was sacred to this equally incautious and absolute
man, and that he was as great an enemy of all
sense and mildness as he was of order and good morals,
produced a striking effect upon the nation, which
fancied itself suddenly removed under an "Oriental
climate."</p>

<p>Some lamented and sighed, others expressed their
amazement or bitterness in one way or the other. But
all were agreed that his Majesty's mild and paternal
heart for his subjects was still the same, if their complaints
and sighs could only penetrate to the throne,
and the real posture of the affair be represented to his
Majesty.</p>

<p>This, however, seemed quite impossible, owing to
the precautions which Count Struensee had taken in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
this respect. He had placed his intimate friend, Count
Brandt, near the king,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and as he, in accordance with
the well-known proverb, <em>nulla amicitia nisi inter bonos</em>,
was not fully convinced of the duration of this friendship,
he sought to insure its permanence by a mutual
interest, and, as will be shown presently, at the expense
of his Majesty and the royal treasury.</p>

<p>Count Brandt, who was always about the king, confirmed
him in everything that Count Struensee alleged
or insinuated, and prevented everybody from having
an opportunity to convince his Majesty of the opposite
truth.</p>

<p>There was no council, and, so to speak, no minister.
No one succeeded in speaking alone with the king, save
those persons of whose devotion Count Struensee considered
himself assured and if it ever happened, it was
only for moments which admitted of no detailed explanation
or discussion. All the rest were held aloof
from his Majesty, which was even extended to his
Majesty's own most exalted relatives and his nearest
family, toward whom the king had formerly displayed
special tenderness and affection. But from the time
when Count Struensee had usurped the administration
of the court and of the whole country, the latter never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
had an opportunity of conversing alone with the king,
as they would not have omitted to represent to his
Majesty the good of his subjects and their grief, of
which these exalted personages afterwards, when the
opportunity was offered, have given incontrovertible
proofs, which can never be sufficiently praised and recognised.</p>

<p>It could not fail but that Count Struensee should
render himself odious to all, through such despotic,
arbitrary, and unreasonable conduct.</p>

<p>His emissaries, and the adherents whom he still possessed,
tried, even though they did not dare to justify
or excuse his undertakings, at least to boast of his asserted
disinterestedness, and to spread far and wide that
he was satisfied with his moderate salary, without asking
either money or honours for himself or his friends.
How far this met with belief may be left an open
question. But it is certain that Count Struensee took
very carefully-devised measures to conceal his selfishness
at that time, and so long as it lasted. But it
was afterwards seen only too plainly that he was an
extremely interested and selfish man, of whom it may
be justly said that he pillaged his Majesty's treasury.</p>

<p>He had a very respectable and considerable salary,
which ought to have been sufficient, as he had everything
free at court down to the very banquets he gave.
He knew, and often enough proclaimed, in what a bad
state the public treasury and his Majesty's were from
former times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>For all that, after the council was dissolved, and
he had become <em>maître des requêtes</em>, he allowed hardly
three months to pass ere he, by an abuse of his Majesty's
good heart, demanded and received from his most
gracious lord a present of 10,000 dollars for himself, and
a similar sum for his friend Count Brandt. It might be
supposed that so considerable a present for these two
persons, of whom one was <em>maître des requêtes</em>, and the
other <em>directeur des spectacles</em>, and who both had only held
these offices for a short time, would have satisfied their
greediness for a while. But, instead of this, we find
that it grew and increased, for Count Struensee, after
receiving the above mentioned present in February or
March, again received in May, or at the end of two or
three months, from his Majesty 50,000 or 60,000 dollars,
and Count Brandt the same sum, so that these
two persons, in the short time of three or four months,
cost his Majesty, in addition to their regular salary,
140,000 dollars, or at least 120,000&mdash;for which of these
two sums is the correct one cannot as yet be stated
with certainty, owing to the confusion prevailing in
Count Struensee's accounts&mdash;and this in addition to
the presents which before and after this date they procured
for their good friends: such as Justiz-rath Struensee
4,000 dollars, Countess Holstein 3,000, Chamberlain
Falckenskjold 3,500 or more, and so on.</p>

<p>That Count Struensee's irresponsible selfishness was
duly considered and intended, is seen from the artificial
machinery which he formed, solely that he might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
able to take these sums without any one detecting
it.</p>

<p>For this purpose, he first proposed the abolition of
what was called the "Trésor"&mdash;which consisted of a
sum of money laid by for unforeseen expenses, and
that it should be paid into the public treasury. As
the Trésor, however, must pass through the cabinet on
its way to the public exchequer, he proposed to his
Majesty to reserve 250,000 dollars of the same, in order
to form a special cabinet treasury which would stand
under his control.</p>

<p>In this way Count Struensee obtained a good opportunity
for receiving considerable sums, without any one
being acquainted with the fact.</p>

<p>He behaved in such a way with this treasury, that
after it was established in April, 1771, and at that time
consisted of 250,000 dollars, at the end of May only
118,000 dollars remained of the original contents,
although the king had no other out-goings but these
presents.</p>

<p>The remaining 118,000 dollars would have gone by
degrees the same road as the others if Struensee had
been allowed sufficient time.</p>

<p>Count Struensee's disgraceful avarice and selfishness
are thus rendered so evident, that those persons
who proclaimed him as disinterested must fairly confess
that they knew him badly, and were not properly informed.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>But this is not sufficient. There is the very
strongest presumption that Count Struensee in this
traffic committed an impudent, disgraceful, and highly
criminal fraud. When the account found among
Count Struensee's papers, and approved by his Majesty,
of the income and expenditure of the special treasury
for the months of April and May, was laid before his
Majesty, as it was considered suspicious, the king at
once declared that he perfectly well remembered
having at that time given 10,000 dollars to the queen,
6,000 to Count Brandt, and other 6,000 to Count
Struensee, but no more. Just as these sums amount
to 22,000 dollars, it is on an inspection of the document
as clear as the sun that the addition was in the
first instance 22,000 dollars, but the first figure two was
converted into a three&mdash;a change which is so visible that
it is at once noticed&mdash;and that a one was afterwards
added, for which there was no other room but in front
of the line drawn underneath, which is quite contrary
to the practice in the other accounts, and in this very
one on the preceding page, where the in-comings are
calculated. Hence, then, the said sum of 22,000
dollars became 132,000, which is proved by the fact
that the two sums of 6,000 dollars for Struensee and
Brandt were converted into 60,000 by the addition of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
cipher, and 2,000 dollars were added for Falckenskjold.
This last sum seems to have been added, in order not
to be obliged to convert the second two into a cipher
in the sum of 22,000 dollars, which had become
130,000.</p>

<p>These suppositions, the real strength of which only
that man can comprehend who has the document in question
before him, is also confirmed by other concurrent
circumstances&mdash;as, for instance, that the account for
April and May is written by Struensee himself, while
the other extracts and calculations are written by the
secretary of the cabinet, which probably occurred
because Count Struensee wished no one to be cognizant
of the embezzlement effected by him, and further by
the fact that, from this time, Count Struensee laid no
account of the treasury before the king until the end
of October, although in June there was an out-going
of 2,000 dollars, which were given to Justiz-rath Struensee.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>This negligence or omission appears to have taken
place purposely, so that his Majesty, after so long an
interval, might not thoroughly remember the real
state of the treasury. To this must be added his
Majesty's own alleged and very natural conjecture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
that it cannot be credited that he gave Counts Struensee
and Brandt 50,000 or 60,000 dollars apiece, while he
only made the queen a present of 10,000.</p>

<p>Count Struensee, who is obliged to confess the
selfishness of having requested this money of the king,
will not, however, acknowledge this embezzlement, but
asserts that his Majesty at that time, on his request,
gave him 50,000 dollars, and Count Brandt the same
sum, and that, as the 10,000 dollars previously given
had not been taken to account, they were included in
this amount. On the document being produced before
the commission, however, he was obliged to allow that
all the facts concurred against him to arouse such a
presumption, which he had no evidence to refute,
while at the same time, he regretted his want of accuracy
and his negligence.</p>

<p>That Count Struensee's ambition was not less than
his avidity, and that his "moderation," as regards
honours and titles, was in no way inferior to that for
money and resources, is equally self-evident.</p>

<p>Within two years he made such progress as others
of greater nobility and higher merit hardly make in
thirty years and more. According to the position
which he occupied, he could not fail to stand in great
honour both at court and in the city. But all this was
not enough for him.</p>

<p>Through constant persuasion he brought it about
that his Majesty appointed him on July 14, 1771,
privy cabinet minister, which design he contrived to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
conceal up to the last moment, even from his most
intimate friends, just as he, and Chamberlain Brandt
were a few days later raised to the rank of counts.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Although as privy cabinet minister he regarded
himself as the first private person in the whole kingdom,
still, the title and the authority he had hitherto
possessed did not suffice him; but he wished to have
prerogatives connected with them which were not at
all seemly for a subject, and involved a portion of the
sovereign authority which belonged to the king alone.</p>

<p>Count Struensee had already seized on all the power,
and as those persons who were about the king spoke
in Struensee's behalf, and his Majesty thus only heard
praises of his minister, it was perfectly natural that he
should have a certain liking for him, and as he was
nearly the only person who discussed the affairs with
his Majesty, it could not fail that the latter should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
consent to everything he proposed. Thus he had
everything that he could crave; but this was not
sufficient to satisfy his immoderate ambition, as the
colleges refused to obey unless they saw the king's
signature.</p>

<p>This did not suit Struensee, and there are grounds
for believing that it did not agree with his secret
designs, and his wish that his signature should be
worth as much as the king's, and that the persons
concerned should obey both signatures.</p>

<p>This he attained by the royal order projected by
himself, which was issued to the colleges on July 15,
1771, with reference to his office as privy cabinet
minister, and was afterwards published by them; for
in the first article of this cabinet order the decrees
signed by Struensee, and provided with the cabinet
seal, were placed perfectly parallel with those signed
by his Majesty himself, and countersigned by Struensee,
and in the fourth article it is expressly ordered
that everybody should execute the cabinet orders
issued and expedited by Struensee. It is true that
this article seems to contain a certain limitation, where
it states, "so far as no royal regulation or resolution
speaks to the contrary;" but what follows on this may
be rather regarded as an extension, for, instead of
stating, as might be expected, that in such a case
execution was to be deferred until a royal resolution
was issued, it continues, "in which case, the fact is to
be immediately reported to the cabinet," so that if any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
one thought it his duty to remonstrate against Struensee
or his order, he would have to apply to Struensee
himself; and if the minister then commanded him to
obey his first order and carry it out, he must do so.
This is what Count Struensee intended and practiced.
In this way, however, he filched a portion of the
sovereignty, and, from what had previously happened,
it might be concluded that he intended to exercise it
alone.</p>

<p>As Struensee acknowledges having read the <em>Lex
Regia</em>, and as he as minister must have been fully
acquainted with its contents, he must have known
that article 7 resolves "that all government decrees,
letters, and documents shall be signed by the king
himself." But the article of the royal law most applicable
here is the 26th, in which the most revered king
and first autocrat, Frederick III., appears to have had
a species of presentiment that a Struensee might one
day arise in Denmark, because it is stated in it how injurious
it is when the mildness and kindness of kings
and masters are so abused that their power and authority
are cut away in an almost imperceptible manner,
and for this reason it is recommended to, and impressed
on, the kings of Denmark zealously to watch over their
sovereignty and autocracy in order to keep it uninjured;
and the conclusion is, that if any one should dare to
desire or appropriate anything which might in any way
be prejudicial to the sovereign authority and monarchical
power of the king, everything of the sort shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
regarded as null and void, and those who have not
hesitated to acquire such a thing, or tried to do so,
shall be punished as insulters of majesty, because they
have committed the greatest crime against the supremacy
of the royal autocracy.</p>

<p>Count Struensee could have read his sentence here,
if he had not committed another and equally coarse
offense against the king's highness, apart from the fact
that he was not only an accomplice and adviser, but
also an inciter of the assault made on his Majesty's
person by his intimate friend Count Brandt.</p>

<p>The way in which Count Struensee exercised the
power and authority entrusted to him as privy cabinet
minister does not excuse him, but, on the contrary, incriminates
him in the highest degree, because it is a
further proof that he regarded the welfare, honour,
life, and property of his Majesty's subjects as purely
dependent on his discretion.</p>

<p>He revoked, by cabinet orders drawn up by himself,
and under his hand, former royal resolutions, of whose
existence he was cognizant.</p>

<p>In the most important affairs he issued orders
without his Majesty's knowledge, and he partly neglected
the extracts from cabinet decrees imposed upon
him as a duty by the resolution of July 15, which he
was to lay before the king every week, or drew them
up in such a way that it was impossible to discover the
nature of the orders, or the effect they were intended
to produce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>When the direction of the privy treasury was entrusted
to him&mdash;for he wished to direct all the treasuries&mdash;he
thought proper to give the cashier fresh
instructions from his hand; and when the cashier represented
to him that he held a royal instruction which
could only be revoked by another royal resolution, he
gave him an answer which contained a species of reprimand,
and ordered him to obey the order and instruction
given by him, Struensee.</p>

<p>The pretty corps of Horse Guards, which was composed
exclusively of Danes and Norwegians, and consequently
did not please Count Struensee&mdash;or, as it
only consisted of two squadrons, was not very expensive&mdash;was
disbanded in February, 1771, by Count
Struensee's proposition, and in accordance with his
wish, but against the opinion of the college.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The Fusilier Guards still remained. They consisted
of five companies, and were composed of none but
clever and trustworthy men, to whom the guard of
the royal palace, and before the apartments of the
royal house, could be safely entrusted; but they possessed
a "quality" which prevented Struensee from
being able to place confidence in them,&mdash;they were
nearly all Danes and Norwegians.</p>

<p>He had long resolved on the reduction of this corps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and spoken with several persons about it, most of
whom, however, dissuaded him. At length he carried
it through, and without his Majesty's knowledge (as
the king himself has declared)<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> issued, on December
21, 1771, a cabinet order to the Generalty and Commissariat
College, by which the five companies of Foot
Guards were to be transformed into five companies of
grenadiers, and one company of them be attached to
each of the five regiments quartered in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>He allowed December 21, 22, and 23 to pass without
telling his Majesty anything about it, although
Struensee, on the 23rd, procured the Generalty the
royal approbation of the said order of the 21st, because
this college required a royal resolution, and refused
without it to execute the cabinet order, as it considered
the affair of too great importance, and foresaw
the consequences that would result from it.</p>

<p>As, however, the Guards on December 24 declared
that their capitulation must be kept, and that it was
contrary to it to make them serve in other regiments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Struensee found himself compelled to lay the whole
matter before his Majesty, and advised that force
should be employed, and the Guards compelled to
obey. However, a royal order was issued on December
24, by which those guards who would not
serve as grenadiers were granted their discharge.</p>

<p>The result of this operation of Count Struensee's
therefore was, that his Majesty lost from his military
service several hundred brave, faithful, and trustworthy
men, who were all natives. Count Struensee's improper
and treacherous conduct in this affair is at
once seen on comparing the protocol kept about the
cabinet orders, with the weekly extract from them,
which was laid before his Majesty.</p>

<p>In the protocol we find the said order of December
21, under No. 709, quoted with the correct date.
After this, several other cabinet orders were drawn
up, to No. 733, on December 22, 23, and 24; but
the second cabinet order of December 24 is not found
among them, but a space is left open at the very end,
in order to book it afterwards. But in the extract
from the cabinet orders expedited from December 18
to 25, which was drawn up on December 31, and
afterwards laid before his Majesty, we find these two
orders of December 21 and 24 quoted together at the
end, under the numbers 22 and 23, just as if they had
been expedited at the same time and under the same
date, while, on the contrary, the cabinet orders issued
from December 22 to 23 are omitted from this extract.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
From this a general idea of the completeness and trustworthiness
of these extracts may be formed.</p>

<p>This protocol further proves how Count Struensee&mdash;although
he had long before sufficiently provided that
no one should bring before the king either verbally or
in writing anything that might injure him, Struensee&mdash;found
himself obliged, at the time when the guards
were dismissed, to take just precautions. For under
date of December 23 he expedited two cabinet orders,
one to (the Danish chief postmaster) Etats-rath Waitz,
in Hamburg, that the packets for his Majesty sent by
post should be addressed to the cabinet, the other to
Court-Intendant Wegener, by which all letters and
parcels sent to the king, and letters and portfolios that
came in from Copenhagen, should not be delivered in
the king's ante-chamber, but in the cabinet. One of
these orders, though they immediately concerned the
king, was entirely omitted in the above-mentioned
extract, while the other was quoted imperfectly, so
that his Majesty was not at all informed of these regulations.</p>

<p>Just as Count Struensee more and more evinced
his distrust of the nation, so the reciprocal hatred of
the nation against him increased more and more (and
was expressed), in various ways. Thus, in the summer
of 1771, various pasquinades were in circulation,
and although their contents and style sufficiently
proved that they emanated from the common
people, still they all displayed the strongest attach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>ment
to his Majesty's person, and a readiness to sacrifice
life and blood for him, while the bitterness had
no other object but the privy cabinet minister and his
adherents.</p>

<p>This, and the fact that a few sailors and others who
believed themselves insulted, went out to Hirschholm
in order to lay their complaints before his Majesty
himself, caused Count Struensee such terror, that he
made preparations and was on the point of taking
flight and running away.</p>

<p>As he, however&mdash;probably by the advice of his
friends&mdash;desisted from this design, it seemed as if he,
on the other hand, prepared to maintain himself in
his post, and against everybody, in every possible
way. This gave cause to various hitherto unknown
measures.</p>

<p>When their Majesties came to town, at which times
Count Struensee always accompanied them, they were
surrounded by an unusual escort; wherever they stopped
in town, at the palace or in the theatre, double
sentries were posted, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Such a course increased the bitterness of the nation,
and especially of the Copenhageners, against Count
Struensee in more than one respect. They saw in it
a proof that he persuaded his Majesty to believe there
were among the inhabitants people who entertained
bad designs against his Majesty and the royal house.
They were confirmed in their suspicion that Count
Struensee entertained other, more extensive, ambi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>tious,
and, at the same time, most audacious and criminal
designs.</p>

<p>It must also be confessed that much of what happened
during this summer, but more especially in
autumn, must confirm them in this belief, and produce
a strong presumption of it, as he has himself
been obliged to confess that several of his measures
were intended to maintain himself in every way in the
situation he occupied.</p>

<p>As already stated, the Horse Guards were disbanded.</p>

<p>As, however, Count Struensee, who always lived in
fear, wished to have some cavalry in the vicinity of
the court, an exercising troop was formed. But, ere
long, he learned that both the officers and men of this
corps were natives, so that they were not at all the
sort he wanted, whence his confidence in them was
lost, and this troop was also disbanded in the autumn.</p>

<p>He then ordered the Seeland Dragoons to the court
and the city, but they have given incontrovertible testimony
that they were no better disposed toward him
than the preceding dragoons.</p>

<p>He now obtained a resolution that two of the regiments
lying in garrison here should be removed to
other towns in the spring. But, instead of letting this
fall on the two youngest regiments, as the rule was,
he wished&mdash;for reasons known to himself, and which
it is not difficult to conjecture&mdash;that they should be
his Majesty the King's, and his brother the Prince
Frederick's, regiments, contrary to the opinion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Generalty, and without informing his royal highness,
the colonel of the latter regiment, or asking his assent
to it. Furthermore, he managed to have a new commandant
of Copenhagen appointed, in whom he believed
he could place full confidence.</p>

<p>But what heightened the distrust most, and excited
the inhabitants of Copenhagen, was the following last-discovered
circumstance, that, according to Struensee's
instructions to the commandant, cannon, with cartridges
and the proper complement of men, were held
in readiness at the arsenal, so that they could be used
at the first signal,&mdash;a regulation which was also concealed
from his Majesty.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The king and the royal house, as well as the whole
nation, must at last lose all patience when they were
compelled to see, in addition to all the rest, how audaciously
he behaved in the harsh and extraordinary
education which he dared to give to the crown prince,
and by which his royal highness ran the greatest risk
of losing his health and life.</p>

<p>Thus, then, the bitterness was raised to the highest
pitch, and must have had the most dangerous consequences,
when a fortunate end was put to the widely-extended
designs and despotic administration of this
vain, thoughtless, arbitrary, and ambitious man.</p>

<p>As it is clear, therefore, that Count Struensee, in
more than one way and in more than one respect, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
both himself committed the crime of high treason in
an eminent degree, as well as participated in similar
crimes with others; and that, further, his whole administration
was a chain of violence and selfishness, which
he ever sought to attain in a disgraceful and criminal
manner; and that he also displayed contempt of religion,
morality, and good manners, not only by word
and deed, but also through public regulations, the following
sentence is passed on him, according to the
words of article 1 of chapter iv. of the 6th book of the
Danish law:&mdash;</p>

<p>Count John Frederick Struensee shall, as a well-deserved
punishment for himself and an example and
warning for others of the same mind, have forfeited
honour, life, and property, and be degraded from his
dignity of count, and all other honours which have
been conferred on him, and his noble coat of arms be
broken by the executioner: John Frederick Struensee's
right hand shall be cut off while he is alive, and then
his head, his body quartered and exposed on the
wheel, but his head and hand shall be stuck upon a
pole.</p>

<p>By Count Brandt's own confession, the declaration
of the ex-cabinet minister John Frederick Struensee,
and various circumstances, it has been already proved
that Count Enevold Brandt was not only Struensee's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
good friend, but also his intimate, whom he (Struensee)
entrusted with his greatest secrets.</p>

<p>In consideration of the gracious intimacy in which
he stood with his Majesty the King, it would have been
his duty, therefore, to prevent all the things which,
according to his own declaration when examined, he
disapproved, and must have recognised in Struensee's
life, sentiments, and undertakings, as foolish, audacious,
and detrimental both for the king and the government
and the country.</p>

<p>Instead of this, he, as a criminal subject and unworthy
confidential servant of the king, made common
cause with Struensee, continually remained his
confidant, and sought to sustain him.</p>

<p>He allowed himself to be employed by Struensee
in keeping everybody from the king, so that nothing
should be revealed to his Majesty about Struensee's
criminal conduct, and the share himself had in it.</p>

<p>To the great concern of all his fellow-subjects he
behaved haughtily, and not with the due respect to
his king, both in private and in the sight of all men.</p>

<p>He did not show the submissive reverence to the
king which every subject owes him, and expresses voluntary
from his heart on every occasion in word and
deed, but he rather opposed the king, in order to
maintain Struensee's favour, and acquire an extravagant
fortune and special advantages for himself.</p>

<p>The memoirs exchanged between him and Struensee
furnish a proof of his unreasonable pretension, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
he was conscious of his reprehensible behaviour toward
the king. From this cause he should have altered his
conduct, or sooner have resigned a post which was repulsive
to him, and for which he did not consider himself
equal. But no, he did not wish to oppose his patron
and protector, who, for his own purposes, desired to
keep him, Brandt, about the king's person, while, on the
other hand, Count Brandt expected greater fortunes in
service and pecuniary affairs from him, Struensee.</p>

<p>As <em>directeur des spectacles</em>, he assisted Struensee in
producing a misunderstanding in the royal family by
contriving that a separate box should be given Prince
Frederick in the playhouse, so that his royal highness
should not be in the king's box, and thus have an opportunity
for revealing to his Majesty, Brandt and his
intimate friend's most culpable conduct.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>He obtained through Struensee in a short period
60,000 dollars from the royal treasury, although he
must have known, or at least could not have doubted,
that he had not earned them by his services or general
conduct.</p>

<p>When he thanked his Majesty for this large sum, he
did not mention the amount which Struensee had procured
him, because he knew that the matter was not
all right, and Struensee had forbidden his doing so,
lest his Majesty might thus be informed of that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the approved extract, found among Struensee's papers,
has since revealed to his Majesty and every other person
who sees the extract.</p>

<p>Count Brandt has been guilty of all this criminality,
although his conscience must reveal to him at every
moment that he was acting as an unfaithful subject,
and against the duty and the bond imposed on him by
the king's gracious familiarity, and in defiance of the
warnings which the two letters from an anonymous
writer found in Brandt's pocket-book so impressively
and clearly contained, by reminding him of his duties,
and advising him what he should do if he did not wish
to risk his head.</p>

<p>He only allowed himself to be ruled and guided by
his arrogance, fortune-hunting, and avarice.</p>

<p>But though the things mentioned appear so criminal,
they cannot be compared with the crime of laying
hands on the exalted person of his Majesty the King,
which Count Enevold Brandt has himself clearly and
regularly confessed in his examination before the commission,
and as it has been proved and confirmed by
several witnesses. For this crime may be regarded
as if Count Brandt wished to hazard the king's death,
because the result of such an assault cannot be foreseen,
and an unlucky blow on a tender part has frequently
caused death.</p>

<p>He was angry with the king, and demanded satisfaction
of his master, whose well-deserved admonition
he ought to have accepted in penitence for his previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
conduct, and have withdrawn himself from his
(the king's) countenance, in order not to irritate him
more.</p>

<p>On the contrary, he consulted with his intimate
friend Struensee how and when he should assault the
king, and reflected what sort of weapon he should
employ, and held it in readiness; but after more
mature reflection, made no use of it.</p>

<p>After he had been warned by Struensee that the
king was now alone, and the right time had arrived,
he goes with reflection, and a firm determination to
avenge himself, in to the king, orders out the two lads
in attendance, and bolts the door, so that no one may
come in to oppose his resolution or to prevent his design,
and forces his Majesty the King, by language
and assault, to offer resistance.</p>

<p>While doing so, he wounds his Majesty in the neck,
bites his finger, and at the same time insults his benefactor
and king by audacious words and expressions
of such a nature that everybody must feel horrified
at repeating them.</p>

<p>It is true that Count Brandt has urged, in his excuse,
that his Majesty has pardoned him for this
occurrence, yet, even were it so, it can only be supposed
that his Majesty wished to overlook so great an
insult for a time. Count Brandt, however, has produced
no proof of this, and his Majesty alone is in a
position to judge how far this indulgence should
extend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>This most atrocious and audacious undertaking of
Count Brandt cannot be regarded otherwise than as an
open attack on the king's person, and the greatest
crime of high treason, which deserves the punishment
attached to such a crime in art. 1, 4th chapter of
the 6th book of the Danish law.</p>

<p>We, therefore, consider ourselves justified in condemning
Count Brandt, and passing the following
sentence:&mdash;</p>

<p>Count Enevold Brandt shall have forfeited honour,
life, and property, and be degraded from his dignity
of count, and all the other honours conferred on him;
his coat of arms shall be broken by the executioner
on the scaffold; his right hand cut off while he is
still alive; then the head; his body quartered and
exposed on the wheel; but his head and hand stuck
on a pole.</p>

<p>These sentences are certainly among the rarest
documents which the annals of justice contain. Struensee
was convicted of a single crime; Brandt was
innocent. In the sentence, Struensee's crime is not
stated, and the whole document is a disgustingly long
narrative of undecided actions, not one of which would
offer grounds for a sentence of death. Reverdil,
usually so cool and impartial, cannot restrain his feelings
when he writes about these atrocious verdicts:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"The sentences were minuted by Wiwet. They
were inserted in the newspapers; among others, the
<em>Leyden Gazette</em>. They seem expressly drawn up
to dishonour the king, the judges, and the country.
The crimes proved are confounded in them with presumptions,
offences with imprudences, faults peculiar
to favourites with those in which, as they were
covered by the king's authority, the culpability falls
on him. In the fear of not charging enough, intentions
and passions are taken into account. In the
sentence passed on Brandt, after describing the scene
of fisticuffs, which so strongly revealed the king's
imbecility, they were not ashamed to add: 'Count
Brandt has certainly alleged in his defence that the
king had pardoned him; but even supposing that the
fact was proved, it could not be understood otherwise
than that his Majesty was kind enough to suffer so
great an extremity for a time. After all, the culprit
has proved nothing in this respect, and his Majesty is
the sole judge of the extent he gives to his own indulgence.'
When this extraordinary document was
read to the man whom it concerned, he said very
justly in his way, that its author deserved a hundred
lashes with a stirrup-leather."</p>

<p>It is not surprising to find that the authenticity of
the sentences was not believed when they were published
in foreign countries. Thus we read in the
<em>Annales Belgiques</em> for May, 1772:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A sentence ought to state the facts simply, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
declare the penalty which is pronounced against the
man who has been guilty of them. Care should be
taken to avoid mixing up in it reasonings and epithets
which denote in the judge a disposition for vengeance
or any passion: now this pamphlet, which is offered us
under the title of a sentence, displays from one end to
the other such marked characters of a violent prejudice
against the condemned, that this in itself would be
sufficient to render it suspicious. It forms a tissue of
vague imputations which can be easily destroyed."</p>

<p>But the dominant faction did not trouble itself
about what might be said: sentence had been passed,
and the next matter of importance was to have it
executed before any revulsion took place in public
opinion.</p>

SERVANT OF THE STATE&mdash;THE QUEEN DOWAGER</span>.</p></blockquote>


<p>On the same day that the sentences were signed by the
Commissioners, Uldall, the counsel, went to Struensee,
in order to inform him of the termination of the trial.</p>

<p>When the advocate entered the cell, he said to the
unhappy victim of a conspiracy:</p>

<p>"Good count, I bring you bad news."</p>

<p>And with these scant words he drew a copy of the
approved sentence out of his pocket.</p>

<p>Calmly and silently the man condemned to such a
cruel death perused the sentence, but not the slightest
alteration took place in his countenance. Then, he
handed the ominous paper to Dr. Münter, who happened
to be with him at the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>While the latter was trembling as he read the sentence,
Struensee began to talk with composure with his
counsel, and asked if all the points of his accusation had
been regarded in passing his sentence, especially that
about the education of the crown prince; to which
Uldall answered in the affirmative. Struensee added,
that he must confess that, if he had had children of his
own, he would not have reared them in any other way.</p>

<p>"And what will Brandt's fate be?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"His sentence is exactly the same as yours," Uldall
replied.</p>

<p>"And could his counsel do nothing to save him?"
Struensee went on to ask.</p>

<p>"He said everything that could be urged in his
favour, but Count Brandt has too much laid to his
charge."</p>

<p>This information caused Struensee greater emotion
than the news of his own fate. But he soon regained
his composure, and added a few words about a petition
to the king for mercy, although he at the same time
expressed his conviction, that even this last step would
meet with no success.</p>

<p>When Struensee and Münter were left alone again,
the man who was now Death's own assured his friend
that his impending punishment did not terrify him.
He had thought that he might be broken on the wheel,
and was already considering whether he could suffer
this kind of death with patience.</p>

<p>"If I have deserved such a death," he then added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
"my infamy would not be removed, though those disgraceful
circumstances were not annexed to it. And
if I had not deserved it, which I cannot assert, sensible
people would do me justice, and I should gain in point
of honour. And upon the whole, what is honour or
infamy in this world to me? My judges had the law
before them, and therefore they could not decide otherwise.
I confess my crime is great: I have violated
the majesty of the king. Many things I might not
have done if I had been sufficiently acquainted with
the law,&mdash;But why did I neglect it?"</p>

<p>These words, uttered by Struensee so shortly before
his death, seemed to reveal a doubt of his perfect innocence.
Perhaps, however, this uncertainty was rather
produced by his conversion to the Christian religion,
by the recollection of past errors, and by the effect of
a long and painful imprisonment; while the imminent
and awful close of his life might also have produced
impressions on him which made him fancy himself
guiltier than he really was. Or was it the voice of his
conscience at the remembrance of the ruin which he
had brought on his young queen, which spoke out of
his soul, though he dared not clothe it in language?</p>

<p>My readers will remember how much this unhappy
man was affected by a letter which he received from
his father, at the time when he still maintained his
irreligious principles. He now delivered to Dr. Münter
a letter for his parents, leaving him the option
whether he would send it at once, or after the execu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>tion.
Münter chose the latter course, as he knew Struensee's
death was very near at hand, and he wished to
save them the anxiety of expecting the melancholy
news of it. The letter was to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your letters have increased my pain; but I have
found in them that love which you always expressed
for me. The memory of all the sorrow I have caused
you, by living contrary to your good advice, and the
great affliction my imprisonment and death must give
you, grieve me the more, since, enlightened by truth,
I see clearly the injury I have done. With the most
sincere repentance I implore your pardon and forgiveness.
I owe my present situation to my belief
in the doctrine and redemption of Christ. Your
prayers and your good example have contributed much
toward it. Be assured that your son has found the
great good, which you believe to be the only true one.
Look upon his misfortune as the means which made
him obtain it. All impressions which my fate could
make or give will be weakened by this, as it has
effaced them with me. I recommend myself to your
further intercession before God. I pray incessantly
to Christ, my Redeemer, that he may enable you to
bear your present calamities. I owe the same to His
assistance. My love to my brothers and sisters.</p></blockquote>

<p>Brandt also received from his defender, Bang, a copy
of the sentence passed on him, and, like Struensee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
sent in a petition for mercy. It was reported that he
would be pardoned. For Owe Guldberg, the most influential
of the judges at Christiansborg Palace, had
thrown himself at the feet of Queen Juliana Maria,
who now held the authority in her hands, and implored
a mitigation of the punishment. But the
queen dowager absolutely refused to listen to him,
not even when Guldberg earnestly implored that at
least Brandt's life might be saved. Crushed by such
harshness, and bitterly undeceived as to the extent of
his influence, he returned to his apartments, threw
himself on the bed, refused to take food, and passed
several days in apathetic reflection.</p>

<p>Brandt's mother and brother asked permission to
come to court to implore the king's clemency, and,
being unable to obtain it, they wrote to the queen
dowager and to Prince Frederick. The answers they
received were full of compliments, but gave them no
hope. It was said, however, that in the council, when
the question of confirming the sentence was discussed,
there were voices for mercy; but that Counts von
Rantzau and Von der Osten absolutely opposed any
being shown. The honour of the king should have
demanded that Brandt's life should be spared, in order
to conceal from the world what had passed between
them, but the king had an extreme repugnance to
this; the mere name of the ex-favourite made him
tremble and turn pale. He positively declared that
he would not save Brandt unless Struensee were also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
spared, and the ministry considered it necessary to
immolate one of the victims, so as not to let the other
escape. The two sentences were consequently confirmed
without the slightest display of clemency.</p>

<p>Count von Rantzau more particularly displayed a
sustained hardness and fearful blackness of soul. He,
doubtless, believed that by closing all access to
clemency, by forcing to the scaffold two intimate
friends, one of whom had been his benefactor, he
should purge himself of the suspicion of complicity,
and that by sheer hypocrisy he should cause his connection
with the condemned men to be forgotten.
At any other time, instead of sitting in the council
and determining the fate of the culprits, he would
have himself been the object of a severe sentence; instead
of being spared for having betrayed the favourites,
there would have been an additional charge against
him, that of anticipating the royal commands to arrest
them; hence, being well aware that, in spite of his
dignities, he was marked, both as a restless and unbelieving
man, he was more assiduous than any one
in his attendance at the court chapel, and joined in
singing hymns, which must have possessed all the charm
of novelty for him.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>How little feeling that most miserable of monarchs,
Christian, really had in the whole matter, is seen by a
perusal of the Danish journals at the time. The
amusements of the court offer a most revolting exhibition
of apathy and want of sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>On April 23, there was a masked ball, <em>en domino</em>,
at which the king, the queen dowager, and their suite
were present; on the 24th, instead of the play, a concert
at the Danish theatre, where the royal family were
present; on the 25th, the sentence on Counts Struensee
and Brandt was pronounced in open court; in the
evening, the opera of <em>Adrien en Syrie</em> was performed.
The small-pox continuing its ravages, on the 26th,
Sunday, profane amusements were interdicted by the
new government. On the 27th, the king dined with
his court at Charlottenlund, and returned to town at
7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>; he signed the sentences, and proceeded to the
Italian Opera. On the 28th, the day of the execution,
there was a grand concert at court. Well may a
writer in the <em>Annales Belgiques</em> for May, 1772,
remark:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If the king has unfortunately reached such a stage
of unfeelingness, what praise does not Caroline Matilda
deserve for having succeeded in captivating him so
greatly that up to the present it was not even suspected
that he possessed such a disposition?"</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Dr. Münter had informed
Struensee, on April 26th, of the promulgation of the
sentences, and that they would be carried into effect
two days after. Struensee listened to him patiently,
and then remarked, as to the circumstances which
were to throw infamy upon his death&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am far above all this, and I hope my friend
Brandt may be the same. Here in this world&mdash;since
I am on the point of leaving it&mdash;neither honour nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
infamy can affect me any more. It is equally the
same to me after death, whether my body putrifies
under ground or in the open air; whether it serves to
feed the worms or the birds. God will know very
well how to preserve those particles of my body which,
on the day of resurrection, are to constitute my future
glorified body. It is not my all which is to be laid on
the wheel. Thank God! I know now very well that
this dust is not my whole being."</p>

<p>After this they conversed quietly about various
matters concerning Struensee's administration. The
decision whether his government had been politically
bad he left to posterity, and many times repeated his
assurance that he was not conscious of any wrong intentions.
When Dr. Münter left him, Struensee handed
him the following letter for Frau von Berkentin at
Pinneberg. This was the patroness who, as chief
gouvernante to the prince royal, had recommended
Struensee as physician in ordinary for the king's foreign
tour:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I make use of the first moments which permit me
to write to you. Business, duties, and my late connexions
have perhaps lessened in me the remembrance
of my former friends, but they have been not able to
obliterate their memory entirely. My present leisure
has revived it. If my silence has aroused suspicion as
to my former sentiments, I beg pardon of all those
who are entitled to my gratitude, and of you, gracious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
lady, in particular. This however, is not the only
advantage which the change of my fate has produced.
I owe my knowledge of truth to it; it has procured
me a happiness of which I had no further expectation,
as I had already lost sight of it. I entreat you to
consider my misfortunes in no other light but that of
religion. I gain more by them than I can ever lose;
and I feel and assure you of this with conviction, ease,
and joy of heart. I beg you to repeat what I now
write in the house of Count Ahlefeldt and at Rantzau.
I am under great obligations to these two families, and
it has grieved me far more to have drawn with me into
misfortune persons who are related to them.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the following day, April 27, Struensee also referred
to his administration, and assured Münter again,
most sacredly, that he had not falsified the accounts
about the presents made by the king to him and
Brandt. Münter's remarks on this subject are worthy
quotation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is difficult to dismiss every suspicion on this
head against Struensee; and if he were guilty, of how
little value would be his conversion! It has made me
uneasy, frequently, and even now, still, after his death.
All manner of appearances, his own confession that he
could not free himself from all suspicion, and many
other evidences, are against him. However, on the
other side, it makes me easy that he confessed greater
and more punishable crimes without constraint, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
denied this with a firmness, calmness of mind and
confidence, which, inexplicable as the matter remains,
makes it difficult to believe him guilty."</p>

<p>Struensee then handed to Münter the following letter
to Chamberlain Christian Brandt, which he desired
him to get delivered:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Permit me to bewail with you and with the gracious
lady your mother, the fate of our dear Enevold. Do
not think me unworthy of sharing your grief with
you, though, accidentally, I have been the cause of it.
You know how much I love him. He was the man
of all the world who possessed the largest share of my
friendship. His misfortunes cause me the greatest
anxiety, and my own have been on his account most
painful to me. He has shared my prosperity with
me, and I trust that we shall now together enjoy that
happiness which our Redeemer has promised us. I
do not know anything wherewith I could comfort you.
You are acquainted with religion. In that I found
a refuge to comfort me on account of my misfortune.
I pray to God that he may at this very moment let
you feel all its power. I shall not cease to entertain
a most lively sense of gratitude toward all those persons
who are dear to me at Rantzau. I am wholly
yours, &amp;c.<br />
<span class="rightlinea">April 27, 1772.</span><br /></p>

<p class="clear">P.S.&mdash;I have been in hopes, and still flatter myself,
that the sentence of my friend will be mitigated.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>To Münter, Struensee declared that Brandt's sentence
of death could not be signed with a good conscience;
for, he said, he could not regard the action
for which his friend's life was forfeited as a crime, and
he, Struensee, did not repent having taken part in it.
On the other hand, he reproached Brandt, because in
his intercourse with the king he neglected the reverence
he owed him, which had also been the reason
why he attracted the king's displeasure on himself.</p>

<p>Of all the letters written by Struensee, the one he
addressed to Count von Rantzau is assuredly the
most remarkable. Instead of the reproaches with
which he might have justly overwhelmed him, he
wrote in the following forgiving spirit:<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This, Sir (Dr. Münter), is what I have begged you
to say in my behalf to Count von Rantzau. I never
entertained any feeling contrary to what his friendship
had a right to expect. Though convinced long ago that
he was acting against me, I did not venture to remove
him from Copenhagen. The facilities I possessed for
doing so, the solicitations addressed to me, and very
powerful reasons not affecting me personally, could not
induce me to do so. The Russian affairs will inform
him of the measures taken against him, of which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
is probably ignorant, as I never spoke to him about
them in detail. I had conceived that his attachment
to his master caused him to find the conduct of his
friend blamable, but it did not enter my mind that he
was capable of engaging any one to render his friend
as unfortunate as possible. Still, convinced by experience,
I have understood that the vivacity of zeal,
circumstances, the persuasion of the peril with which
the king was believed to be menaced, might stifle
every other feeling. I have retained no bitterness
against the count. Having been since enlightened by
religion, I have preserved all the feelings of a personal
attachment for him which, through various signs, his
memory will, doubtless, bring before his eyes. I offer
up vows for his prosperity. It is not in my power to
give him stronger proofs than by ardently wishing
that he may find the happiness which the truth of religion
has taught me to know. I would desire the
count, on this point, to remember, by analogy, his
prejudices against medicine, and how he removed them
by reading "Zimmermann," and by experiencing the
good effects of the medicines I administered to him at
Glückstadt. May these few words efface everything
that the count nourishes against me in his mind! You
will deliver this note to him, Sir, when no further motives
are in existence which may make him attribute
this step of mine to any other object.<br />
<span class="rightlinea">S<span class="smcap">TRUENSEE</span>.</span><br /></p>

<p class="clear">P.S. Having altered my mind, I have the honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to address this note directly to the count, instead of
entrusting it to Dr. Münter.</p>

<p>This 27th April, 1722. <span class="rightlinea">S.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="clear">Struensee did not wish to take a personal farewell
of his brother, Justiz-rath Struensee, because he was
afraid that this might produce a scene which would be
too affecting for both of them. He therefore begged
Münter to do so for him. He entreated his brother's
pardon for drawing him into his misfortunes, but
hoped and was certain that his affairs would turn out
well. He also assured him that he was leaving the
world with true brotherly affection for him. He also
wished his brother to be told of the sentiments in
which he died. This commission Dr. Münter discharged
on the same evening, and carried back the
answer of the much afflicted brother.</p>

<p>Brandt also received on April 27, from his chaplain,
Dean Hee, the news of the confirmation of his sentence
and the day of execution, which he heard unconcerned,
and said that he readily submitted to the
will of God.</p>

<p>A report had been spread that Brandt had spoken
recklessly while in prison, and sung merry songs.
Hence the dean made a proposition to him, which he
left to him to accept or not, that he should make a
declaration of what his real sentiments were, in the
presence of witnesses. He readily complied with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
proposal, and Hee went to the commandant, who
came with four officers, in whose presence Brandt
declared that he was ready to die, and was not afraid
of it; he likewise confessed before the omniscient God,
that he had without hypocrisy sought for God's mercy;
he likewise confessed, as he had done before, that he
had acted very inconsiderately, that his levity had
been very great, and that he, on this account, acknowledged
God's mercy in suffering him to die, lest he
should be drawn away again from religion. He said,
he knew very well that the same levity of temper had
induced him, in the beginning of his imprisonment, to
talk in a manner he was now ashamed of, though he
was sure in his conscience that many untruths were
invented, and propagated among the people, but he
forgave those who had been guilty of such a thing.
Now, he wished that the gentlemen present would
bear testimony to what he should say. He acknowledged
himself a great sinner before God: a sinner
who had gone astray, but was brought back by Christ.
He then begged the commandant and the other officers
to forgive him, if, by his levity, he had offended
any one of them, and wished that God's mercy in
Christ might always attend them as the greatest blessing.
He said all this with such a readiness, and in
such moving terms, that all who were present were
affected by it, and every one of them wished that God
would preserve him in this situation of mind to the
last.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the town council, the police, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
military authorities, were making preparations for the
execution. Copenhagen is surrounded on the land
side, next the three suburbs, by three large fields bordered
by neat <em>allées</em>, which are used as exercising
grounds for the garrison, and for public festivities. On
the easternmost of these fields, situated on the Sound,
a scaffold, 8 yards long and broad, and 27 feet in
height, was erected; and on the gallows hill, a mile
distant, and situated in the western suburb, two poles
were planted, both of which were surrounded by four
wheel-posts. It took some trouble to complete this
job, because no artisans consented to undertake it. It
was not until other workmen were persuaded that a
pleasure-house was to be built on the field that the
scaffold was completed. No wheelwright was willing
either to supply the wheels; so that the eight carriage
wheels required had to be begged from friends of the
court party.</p>

<p>When dawn broke on the 28th of April, 1772, a day
which inflicted an eternal stain on the history of Denmark,
the troops, consisting of 4,400 sailors belonging
to the vessels in ordinary, and armed with pikes, 1,200
infantry, 300 dragoons, and, strange to say, the corps
of military cadets, marched through the gates, in order
to form a large circle round the stage of blood on the
Osterfeld, keep back the eager countless mob, and be
ready for any eventualities. General von Eickstedt,
town commandant, had the supreme command of all
the troops.</p>

<p>The two gates of the citadel were also kept shut till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the departure of the criminals; and the posts had been
doubled in order to keep off the pressure of the crowd,
who also congregated eagerly here.</p>

<p>The two clergymen went at an early hour to the
condemned men, and found them both calm and easy
in mind. When Münter entered, Struensee was fully
dressed, and lying on a couch. He was reading Schlegel's
sermons on Christ's Passion, and a religious conversation
began between the two, during which Münter
looked very often toward the cell door with a fearful
expectation; but the count not once.</p>

<p>At length the officer on duty came in and requested
Münter to step into the coach, and precede Struensee
to the place of execution. Münter was greatly moved,
but Struensee, as if it did not concern himself the
least, comforted him by saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Make yourself easy, my dear friend, by considering
the happiness I am going to enter into, and with the
consciousness that God has made you a means for procuring
it for me."</p>

<p>Soon after, the two delinquents were requested to
get into their coaches, Brandt going on first. The
latter, after praying fervently, had had his chains, which
were fixed in the wall, taken off, and he put on the
clothes in which he intended to appear on the scaffold.
He then drank a dish of coffee and ate something, walking
up and down the room, which he had not been
able to do before. As often as Dr. Hee asked him how
he found himself, he said that he was not afraid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
dying. He afterwards asked Hee whether he had seen
anybody executed before, and how far he was to lay
his body bare for the execution.</p>

<p>Struensee was dressed in a blue cut velvet coat
with silver buttons; Brandt in a green court dress
richly embroidered with gold, and both had costly fur
pelisses thrown over them, but, as if in mockery, still
had a chain on their hand and foot. This gay attire
had been given them in order to remind the populace
that the dizzy fall from the greatest power to the
scaffold was the just punishment of their unparalleled
crimes. By the side of each of the prisoners sat an
officer, and opposite to them two sergeants. The two
coaches were surrounded by 200 infantry soldiers with
fixed bayonets, and an equal number of dragoons with
drawn sabres. The procession was opened by a third
coach, in which the Fiscal General and the king's
bailiff were seated, and, facing them, the latter's deputy,
holding two tin shields, on which the arms of
the two counts were painted.</p>

<p>Half-past eight was striking from the tower of the
citadel when the three coaches began their progress to
the scaffold, where they were expected by upwards of
30,000 persons.</p>

<p>When the procession reached the spot, the Fiscal
General and the king's bailiff with his assistant first
mounted the scaffold, on which the executioner and
his aids were awaiting their victims. They were followed
by Brandt; his features were so unchanged, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
his bearing was so perfectly calm, that it was generally
supposed that a hope of mercy was aroused in his
mind at this supreme moment. Dean Hee mounted
the scaffold stairs immediately after him, and it was
not till they reached the top that the prisoner's fetters
were removed. Even here he assured Hee that his
mind was composed, and that he was not afraid of
death. The dean, however, continued to encourage
him, and concluded with the words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Son, be of good cheer, for thy sins are forgiven
thee."</p>

<p>To which Brandt replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes; they are all cast into the depths of the
sea."</p>

<p>The king's bailiff, Etats-rath Ortwed, now read the
sentence; and when he had finished, the executioner
advanced to receive the count's coat of arms. He
asked Brandt whether it was his escutcheon, to which
the other replied by a nod; he then swung it in the
air, and broke it with the words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is not done in vain, but as a just punishment."</p>

<p>After the clergyman had read Brandt those things
from the ritual which are usual on such occasions, Hee
asked him whether, in addition to his other sins, he
repented of his great crime of high treason? Brandt
answered in the affirmative, and then added:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I pray God, the king, and the country, for forgiveness,
and only wish that God may bless the king and
the whole land for the sake of Christ's blood."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>After these words the clergyman gave him the benediction,
and, taking him by the hand, delivered him
over to justice. When the executioner approached
to assist Brandt in undressing, the latter said to him
with firmness, though not without mildness, "Stand
off, and do not presume to touch me!" He quickly
let his pelisse fall, took off his hat, and himself removed
his coat and waistcoat. After previously
feeling in all the pockets, which he doubtless did out
of habit, he also began to bare the right arm, from
which the hand was to be cut off, but the executioner
now advanced, and helped him to bare the whole arm
as well as his neck.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> After this, Brandt knelt down,
and laid his head on one block and his hand on another.
When the victim had thus offered himself for
the execution of the sentence, the clergyman reminded
him of the posture of the Saviour in the garden of
Gethsemane, with his face on the ground, to which
Brandt, lying on the block, replied in a loud voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The blood of Christ intercedeth for me."</p>

<p>Hee stepped back, and while he was saying, "O
Christ, in Thee I live, in Thee I die! Oh! thou
Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world,
be merciful!" the execution was over. Brandt did
not die as a hypocrite, but at the same time displayed
no defiance.</p>

<p>Immediately after, the executioner's aids advanced,
stripped the body, and then divided it into four
quarters with an axe. Each quarter was let down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
separately by a rope into a cart standing below, and
the vessels with the entrails were also placed in it.
Lastly, the head was held up, shown to the spectators,
and then let down into the cart, together with the
hand. After which the scaffold was strown with fresh
sand, in readiness for Struensee.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>During this awful tragedy Struensee sat in his
coach, which was standing near the scaffold. When
Brandt went up, Münter ordered the coach to be
turned in such a way that they might not witness
Brandt's execution. But Struensee's eyes had already
found his unfortunate friend, and hence he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have seen him already."</p>

<p>After some further exhortation, Münter said to the
prisoner:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Christ prayed for his murderers even on the
cross. May I rely upon your leaving the world with
the same sentiments of love toward those whom you
might have reason to think your enemies?"</p>

<p>"In the first place," Struensee replied, "I hope
that there is no one who has a personal hatred against
me; but that those who have promoted my misfortunes,
have done it with the intention of doing good.
Secondly, I look upon myself already as a citizen of
another world, and consider that I am obliged to entertain
sentiments conformable with this dignity; and I
am sure that if I were to see those who might perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
be my enemies here in the bliss of that world which I
hope to enter into, it would give me the highest satisfaction.
I pray to God that if my enemies hereafter
repent of their behaviour toward me, this repentance
may induce them to look out for that salvation which I
confidently promise myself through the mercy of God."</p>

<p>Struensee, during this conversation, suffered no
other change than that he appeared very pale, and
thinking and speaking evidently cost him more trouble
than they had done earlier in the morning. Still he
retained perfect composure, and saluted some of those
around the coach by raising his hat, or by friendly
glances. From the motion of the spectators, Dr.
Münter, though he could not see the scaffold, guessed
that Struensee's turn to ascend it had arrived, and
that, with Brandt's death, all hope of a pardon had
disappeared.</p>

<p>When summoned by name, Struensee stepped out
of the coach, and went, led by Münter, with dignity
though humbly, through the ranks of favoured spectators,
and bowed to them also. With difficulty he
ascended the fifteen steps leading to the scaffold.
When they reached the top, Münter spoke very concisely,
and in a low voice, upon the words, "He that
believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he
live." After this the sentence of the Commission of
Inquiry and the royal confirmation were read to
Struensee, and the king's own signature was shown
him. Then came the breaking of the coat of arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
after which Struensee's chains were taken off. The
clergyman once again went up to Struensee, and asked
him various questions.</p>

<p>"Are you very truly sorry for all those actions by
which you have offended God and man?"</p>

<p>"You know my late sentiments on this point,"
Struensee replied, "and I assure you they are this
very moment just the same."</p>

<p>"Do you trust in the redemption of Christ as the
only ground of your being pardoned before God?"</p>

<p>"I know no other means of receiving God's mercy,
and I trust in this alone."</p>

<p>"Do you leave this world without hatred or malice
against any person whatever?"</p>

<p>"I hope nobody hates me personally; and as for
the rest, you know my sentiments on this head; they
are the same as I told you before."</p>

<p>Doctor Münter then laid his hand upon Struensee's
head, and said with deep emotion, before he delivered
him up to justice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then go in peace whither God calls you! His
grace be with you!"</p>

<p>Struensee then took off his fur pelisse, removed his
hat, and tried to undress himself, but his strength
failed him in doing so, and he was obliged to ask the
executioner's help. After this he produced a white
handkerchief to bind his eyes with, but the executioner
said that it was not necessary, and then assisted him
in removing his shirt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Struensee then walked with hesitating steps the
few yards leading to the block, which still reeked with
the blood of his dearest friend; a stronger mind than
Struensee ever possessed might have been unhinged by
the dreadful scene before his eyes. He knelt down,
but had great difficulty in placing himself in the
proper position. As the executioner raised the axe to
cut off his right hand, Münter began slowly pronouncing
the words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Remember Jesus Christ crucified, who died, but
is risen again."</p>

<p>The first blow fell, and with it, Struensee was
attacked by violent convulsions, the result of which
was, that the second blow intended to behead the poor
wretch, failed. He sprang up convulsively, but the
assistant seized him by the hair, and pulled him down
on the block by force; even when the head was
removed, a portion of the chin was left behind.</p>

<p>The same horrors were committed on his poor corpse
as on Brandt's, but I have no heart to dwell on them:
let us rather agree with the poet in saying,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Excidat illa dies ævo: nec postera credant</div>
  <div class="i0">Sæcula: nos certé taceamus et obruta multa</div>
  <div class="i0">Nocte tegi nostræ patiamur crimina gentis."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The mangled remains, after they had been thrown
into the cart, were conveyed all through the city to
the field at the other extremity, where they were to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
left to moulder or be devoured by the fowls of the air.
For each, four stout balks were, at equal distances,
driven into the earth; a taller pole was fixed in the
centre; the entrails, &amp;c., were buried in a hole dug
at the foot of the central pole; on the top the head
was fixed, the pole being forced up inside the skull,
through which a spike was driven to make it fast;
the hand was nailed on a piece of board, placed transversely
below the head; a cart wheel was fixed
horizontally on the top of each of the four posts or
pillars, on which a quarter of the body was exposed,
made fast to the wheel by iron chains.</p>

<p>The countless crowd, whose curiosity was now fully
satisfied, returned to the city, shaken by the scenes
they had witnessed, and the deep impression produced
by the awful drama could be noticed for a long time.
Convicts had to be employed on the next day in
removing the scaffold, as no honest man would have a
hand in it; but Gallows Hill preserved its decorations
for some years, and even in 1775, Mr. Coxe saw
Struensee's and Brandt's skulls and bones there.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> All
this was done to satiate the vengeance of the queen
dowager. With a telescope in her hand, Juliana Maria
had witnessed the whole execution from the tower of
the Christiansborg, and when the turn arrived for
the special object of her hatred, Struensee, she rubbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
her hands joyously, and exclaimed, "Now comes the
fat one."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>But the queen did not neglect to observe decorum
even in this affair, and hence, soon after the execution,
sent for Dr. Münter, in order to hear all the details
of the judicial murder from this immediate witness of
the fearful scene. When he had ended his report, the
queen burst into tears; but, as our Danish authority
remarks, "it is notorious that a crocodile can weep."
Then she said to Münter&mdash;</p>

<p>"I feel sorry for the unhappy man. I have examined
myself whether in all I have done against him
I have acted through any feeling of personal enmity;
but my conscience acquits me of it."</p>

<p>After this, the queen dowager gave Dr. Münter a
snuff-box of rock crystal, while a similar gift in porcelain
was forwarded to Dean Hee.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>But the historian, Suhm, who was attached to the
court, and was one of the most zealous enemies of
Struensee, tells us how far we are justified in believing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the queen dowager's statement. As the queen
occupied the upper floor of Christiansborg Palace,
whence a view of the Gallows Hill was obtained,
Chamberlain Suhm asked her some years later, why
her Majesty, who had so many splendid palaces at her
service, inhabited these unpretending rooms, and received
the answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And yet these rooms are dearer to me than all
my most splendid apartments; for from these windows
I saw my bitterest foe exposed on the wheel."</p>

<p>Such was the end of a man whose miserable story is
indubitably one of the most romantic episodes of his
century; and it only required a Danish Walter Scott, in
order to make of it an historical romance of the first
class. For such a work the matter is fully sufficient.
But for the same reason all efforts must fail to convert
Struensee into the hero of a tragedy. Many poets, some
of them in the first flight, have undertaken this ungrateful
task, but have not attained any success worth mentioning.
The reason can easily be found. Struensee
was no hero; not even an original: he possessed no distinct
character, but was merely a type of his age, and
in spite of his undeniable talents, he was an ordinary
adventurer after all. Fortune is as much the touchstone
of minds as misfortune is. It subjected this man
to a trial, and he came out of it badly. Arrogant and
unbridled in fortune, he proved himself in misfortune
despondent, cowardly, and even worthless. The fortune
which he at first did not turn to a bad use, brought a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
king's sceptre into his hand, and he allowed it to be
shamefully torn from him by people far inferior to him
in intellect. A queen, young and beautiful as a May
morning, supported him, and he betrayed her. He
had felt a pride in being an avowed free-thinker, and he
died with wailing and gnashing of teeth, as a penitent
sinner. No, he was not a tragic hero. Even the genius
of a Shakspere would have failed in rendering him one.</p>

<p>It is a fact worthy of attention that Struensee possessed
none of the qualities which generally presuppose
success at court. He was not an amiable man, in the
conventional sense of the term. The English envoy,
Gunning, who was not ill-disposed toward him, expressly
stated, in a despatch of April, 1770, that Struensee
did not at all display in his conversation the
liveliness and pleasantry by which other men pave the
way to fortune. "His mode of behaving and expressing
himself is dry and even unpleasant, so that it was a
subject of general surprise how he contrived to acquire
such unbounded influence over the king and queen."
Further, the envoy allows the favourite "no inconsiderable
acquirements," but denies him all statesman-like
ability and political tact. At the same time he
was deficient in sufficient insight into Danish affairs.
He was tolerably free from vanity, but not from an
immoderate self-confidence, which not unfrequently
degenerated into "impudence." The envoy, however,
supplies us with the key to the enigma of Struensee's
sudden elevation, when he mentions that he was "bold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and enterprising," and such a man is sure to make his
way among women.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Still, in spite of Struensee's deficiency and all his
mistakes, so much justice must be done him as to
allow that he desired the welfare of the state. He
originally possessed a not ignoble mind, which was
lowered and degraded by his fabulous elevation and
sudden fall. Being formed of much softer and more
worthless stuff than the metal out of which great, or
even second-rate statesmen are composed, he could
not endure either fortune or misfortune. An idealist,
trained in the school of enlightened despotism, he did
not understand that a nation must be raised from the
bottom to the top. This was the mistake of the age.
The reasons of state of a Frederick the Great or a
Joseph II. were, after all, only an improvement of the
breed. We have all due respect for those enlightened
despots who have so far freed themselves from the
swaddling-clothes of the Byzantine ideas about the divine
right of kings, as to wish themselves to be merely
regarded as the first servants of the state; but, at the
same time, we are inclined to say with old Wieland,
"May Heaven protect us from the luck of being obliged
to live under the sceptre or stick of such first servants
of the state." Struensee acted on the principle that,
in order to make nations progress, nothing further was
required than to realise by edicts the principles of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
French philosophers and German illuminati. After
the fashion of many other world-betterers of the age,
he did not know or reflect that it is far more difficult
to lead the unjudging masses to what is good, than to
what is bad; that the most absurd prejudices of the
plebs must be humoured far more than the noblest
human privileges; that the coarse diplomacy of pot-house
demagogues is sufficient to make the ignorant
mob throw away the diamonds of truth and eagerly
clutch at the <em>strass</em> of falsehood and absurdity; and
that, lastly, the people in all times are most willing, at
the desire of their enemies, to hate, persecute, stone,
and crucify their friends.</p>

<p>It is possible, even probable, that, if Struensee had
held the power longer, he would have passed from the
experimentalising stage to really beneficial results.
The beginning of his display of power was not so bad.
Denmark had long sighed under the brutal dictatorship
which the envoys of Russia exercised. Struensee
broke this yoke, and did it so cleverly, that the ambitious
czarina in Petersburg was obliged to give way,
whether she liked it or not. The management of the
foreign policy by Struensee least of all deserves blame,
because it was based on the sensible principle that
Denmark must live in peace and amity with all
states, but not be subject to any one of them. The
same praise cannot be afforded to Struensee's home
administration. The tendency generally was good and
reasonable here, but the execution left much, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
much, to be desired. We find everywhere hasty attempts,
but no thorough carrying through. A despotic
theorising, which was followed by no energetic practice,
and the most correct designs destroyed and confused
by the interference of personal interests, sympathies,
and antipathies, characterised the administration.</p>

<p>Struensee's great fault was that he did not, and
would not, understand that in statesman-like calculations,
not abstract ideas but men are the figures employed
in reckoning&mdash;men with all their weaknesses,
follies, prejudices, and passions. Through mistaking
this great fact, he contrived to embitter all classes of
the nation. He offended the nobles without winning
the peasants; he made the officers, soldiers, and sailors
his enemies, without making the citizens his friends.
And he did this among a people whose education was
behindhand, and to whom he was an object of hatred,
from the fact of his being a foreigner.</p>

<p>After his fall, which every one but himself had foreseen&mdash;and
we may fairly say that he signed his own
death-warrant by the maniacal cabinet decree which
placed all the authority in his hands&mdash;Struensee
behaved like a miserable coward and traitor. It has
been said that his judges, or, more correctly, executioners,
terrified the ruined man by a menace of the
torture, and, at the same time, deluded him by the
idea that his sole chance of salvation was in compromising
Caroline Matilda most deeply. But, for all
this, a man would never do, and only a weakling and
coward would do what he did, when he confessed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
on February 21, that he had been the queen's lover.
From this moment he could only lay claim to a feeling
of contempt. It would not even excuse him were it
true, as has been alleged, that a pretended confession
of Caroline Matilda's guilt was shown him.</p>

<p>Still the means employed to get rid of the favourites
were most reprehensible. It is true that the queen
dowager and Prince Frederick had a right to feel
irritated at having no credit at a court where a
Struensee domineered, and that they wished to remove
him and his partisans. We can understand that Queen
Juliana Maria, who had no experience of business, and
Prince Frederick, who had scarce emerged from boyhood,
should not suspect the extremities to which
Guldberg's faction would lead them; and it may be
true that it was owing to their generosity that the
children of Caroline Matilda were not deprived of
their rights. Nor can we positively condemn Guldberg
for wishing to tear from Struensee powers which
Struensee had torn from others. Perhaps Guldberg
possessed more capacity, or a better claim to hold the
power than he. But, as to the means employed in
gaining the object, we cannot help agreeing with
Falckenskjold when he says:</p>

<p>"To make Struensee perish in order to seize on his
office, was not this purchasing it very dearly? and
especially to add the punishment of the unfortunate
Brandt to that of Struensee, and to assail the liberties
and fortunes of so many persons who were innocent of
the ambition of these two men. And, in order to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
a legal appearance to these proscriptions, they do not
hesitate to abuse whatever is most sacred in human
laws; they convert private intrigues into judicial proceedings;
they employ calumnious libels as authentic
documents and sentences; they raise the veil and expose
to the public the domestic secrets of the king's
house! They do not fear violently to break the happy
union of the king with his consort; to render doubtful
the rights of the issue of that union, by compromising
the future tranquillity of the state; and, lastly, to cast
on a young queen the affront of a mortal stain, and to
condemn her to expire in a lengthened agony!</p>

<p>After the execution of the two counts, the turn came
for the other ten prisoners of state to be disposed of.
In order to justify in the sight of Europe the sanguinary
treatment of the two principal victims, these
prisoners must also appear in the light of state
criminals, although no actual offence could be proved
against a single one of them. Although the grounds
for their sentences are of the most paltry description,
it is easy to discover in them that, after the removal of
their real enemies, the dominant faction wished to
affect a display of mercy, probably through fear of
public opinion, which was beginning to be loudly expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
both at home and abroad, about the cruel fate
of the two counts.</p>

<p>The court believed it necessary to lay before the
nation in print the sentences of Counts Struensee and
Brandt, and with them a list of the crimes for which
they were tried. This measure, however, had the contrary
effect to what was expected. Nothing was seen
in this sentence but a desire to prove the counts
guilty, and a long series of absurd conclusions, by which
it was sought to attain this object: the sentence on Count
Brandt, more especially, revolted every one, and the
general dissatisfaction was unmistakable.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Hence, although
it was proposed in the council to lop off one
or two more heads, one of the judges, Kofod Ancher,
thought it was time to say to the king, as was said
to Augustus, <em>siste carnifex</em>. It was therefore decided
that the only victim of judicial vengeance should be
Falckenskjold, who had dared to be an honest admirer
of Struensee, and was really at the same time an enlightened
statesman and politician.</p>

<p>On April 21 a royal command was sent to the commissioners
to hand in an accurate representation of the
offences of all the other persons arrested on January 17,
and more especially those who had been guilty of
minor crimes. This order was executed in a "most
humble" report, dated May 5. The poor wretches
had been allowed to pass all this time in prison, suffering
from the most painful uncertainty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Frau von Gähler was placed at the head of the list
as the least guilty sinner. She had attracted suspicion&mdash;so
it was stated in the report&mdash;by her intercourse
with Struensee, by an uninterrupted correspondence
during the Holstein progress with her husband in
Copenhagen, by her being selected to be constantly in
attendance on the queen, by her and her husband's
decoration with the queen's Order of Matilda; and
lastly, by the rumour that important papers had been
entrusted to her care. As, however, the closest investigation
had not produced a tittle of proof against her,
and her correspondence with her husband proved to be
of the most innocent nature, while other ladies who
stood under no suspicion had enjoyed equal favour at
court, the commission had discovered nothing that
could be brought as a charge against her.</p>

<p>A similar declaration was issued by the commission
in the matter of Lieutenant-Colonel von Hesselberg.
This officer who&mdash;on account of the acquirements he
had gained on foreign service, and the intelligence displayed
by him while holding an appointment at the
Academy of Military Cadets, had been proposed by
Falckenskjold as lieutenant-colonel of the king's regiment,
because the latter wished to have an efficient
representative, while he went on diplomatic business to
Russia&mdash;had received orders to have an eye on Struensee's
youngest brother, who was appointed to his
regiment. Such was the state crime brought against
this man of honour by the exalted commissioners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>As an example of the condition of the Danish army
at that day, the circumstances connected with Hesselberg's
appointment will be perused with interest.
When Falckenskjold, shortly after his arrival from
Russia, was appointed colonel of the king's regiment,
the quartermaster delivered to him an account of the
state of the regimental chest, according to which there
ought to be 25,000 dollars in it. Falckenskjold replied,
that he would take over the chest after a committee
of inquiry had sat. The quartermaster objected
that this was displaying an unusual suspicion,
but Falckenskjold stuck to his text, and lo and behold!
there were but 95 dollars in the chest. On his
threatening to report the affair, 5,000 dollars were produced,
and the quartermaster bolted. A close investigation
proved that the missing sum had been stolen by
frauds, in which the officers were mixed up, and
Falckenskjold was at last obliged to let the matter
drop, but for this very reason selected Hesselberg,
in whom he could trust, as his second in command.</p>

<p>The third ill-used man, against whom the commission
could not produce a <em>scintilla</em> of evidence either,
was Rear-Admiral Hansen. He had first formed Struensee's
acquaintance when he received orders to join
the Algerine Committee, and afterwards assumed a
special command in the expedition. He had never
spoken on any matters but those connected with the
navy to Struensee, and yet was kept for months in
prison as a dangerous criminal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Equally little could be alleged against Councillor of
Legation Sturtz. His connection with Struensee had
never possessed an intimate character, which was proved
by the fact, that he had remained attached to Bernstorff.
The sole reason for his lengthened residence
at Hirschholm, in the summer of 1771, was, that he,
as a clever amateur in portrait-painting, had received
a commission to take the likeness of the queen and
prince royal, and the diamond ring presented to him
by the queen for his bride, was only an acknowledgment
given him for these works of art, which are still
in existence, and said to be excellent likenesses. Nor
was anything in the slightest degree incriminating
found among his papers.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Aboe, of the navy, was the next prisoner
declared to be innocent. When a cadet he had formed
the acquaintance of Brandt, and became intimate with
him, partly on account of the pecuniary assistance the
latter gave him, partly to be recommended to Chamberlain
Struensee, through whose application he obtained
the interim post of master of the crews at the
navy docks, and of adjutant to the Algerine expedition.
In the latter capacity he frequently waited on
Struensee, and handed in some pretended ameliorations
in the administration of the navy, which, however,
only proved his ignorance. He had no further
connection with Struensee, and was, indeed, offended
with the cabinet minister, because the latter did not
sufficiently recognise his merits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>The examination had thus proved that five innocent
persons had been kept in a state of torturing uncertainty
as to their fate, and in cruel imprisonment
for four months and a half, while their relatives were
exposed to public contumely.</p>

<p>Of Etats-rath Willebrandt it was alleged that he had
been so simple and bold as to wish to reform the Admiralty
College, without having gained a proper insight
of the administration of the navy, much less of the
difference in the business of the department during
peace and war, as he had solely obeyed the order
given him to establish the Admiralty College after the
pattern of that of the Generalty. The commissioners,
it is true, declared that it was not within their competence
to judge the value of a plan which in any case had
been approved by his Majesty, and for this reason did
not dare to express dissatisfaction with it. Still they
thought themselves at liberty to state that which the
result proved, that a portion of the plan, owing to
Willebrandt's ignorance, produced irregularity and inconveniences,
which could only be prevented by alterations
and fresh expenses for the king's treasury.
After this, an allusion was made to the affair with the
enrolled sailors, who marched on Hirschholm in 1771.
Willebrandt's offence, therefore&mdash;the report went on
to say&mdash;consisted in his having undertaken to reform
things of which he had no thorough knowledge, and
he thus produced scenes which might easily have
had dangerous consequences. It was not mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in the report, however, that the king had given him
this order, that Count Haxthausen took part in it,
and that both, when they drew up the plan, expressly
requested that the new scheme might be previously
examined by <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'prfoessional'">professional</ins> men.</p>

<p>Professor Berger, the physician in ordinary, also
appeared to the commission to have committed an
offence. It was true that all the medicines found in
his house proved to be innocuous; there was no proof
that the steel cure attempted on his Majesty was
improper; in the matter of the rearing of the crown
prince he had not agreed in all points with Struensee,
but rather had been the cause that warmer clothing
and better food were granted his royal highness toward
the close: it was also true that he expressed his anger
at Struensee having acquired a power which he considered
prejudicial to the nation; but he had given
serious offence by concurring with Struensee, and
giving his advice and propositions in reforms of which
he probably knew nothing, more especially in things
which did not concern his trade as physician, or the
<em>res literariæ</em> generally. As a proof of this, it was alleged
that he had proposed some persons to fill the
places of the dismissed members of the magistracy,
and that Struensee requested him to mention a person
who would be suitable for the chief post in the navy
yards. Still the commission would not venture to
judge of the use or disadvantage of such propositions,
as the papers found on the accused and the other pri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>soners,
on which their argument must be founded,
contained no information about them.</p>

<p>This was everything that could be brought against
a professional man, who, in spite of his zealous attention
to the king's health, and his well-earned reputation,
was dragged to the fortress, and, like a murderer,
prohibited the use of knife and fork, and was
not allowed to shave himself, or sleep on his own
mattress.</p>

<p>If the conduct of the commission had hitherto retained
a varnish of justice, the royal resolution, minuted
by Councillor of Conference Schumacher, and
issued on May 18, was a strange proof of tyranny,
which smote truth on the face with open falsehoods.
For it was stated in this resolution, that the persons
who had been guilty of the "smallest crimes" should
be punished in the following way:&mdash;</p>

<p>Frau von Gähler would be set at liberty, but must
refrain from appearing at court so long as her husband's
affair was not concluded.</p>

<p>Rear-Admiral Hansen and Lieutenant Aboe would
be discharged from arrest, and report themselves to
the Admiralty College, where they would learn the
king's commands with respect to them.</p>

<p>Legations-rath Sturtz would also be released from
arrest, and ordered to proceed to Holstein. He would
retain his pension of 500 dollars, which had been
granted him by the royal resolution of January 26,
but must expend it away from the court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Etats-rath Willebrandt, after being discharged,
would proceed to one of the small towns in Seeland,
where an annual pension of 300 dollars would be paid
him.</p>

<p>Professor Berger, lastly, after being set at liberty,
would go to Aalborg, in northern Jütland, where a
pension of 300 dollars would be paid him, until a post
of provincial surgeon became vacant in Jütland.</p>

<p>These decisions the commissioners made known to
the persons concerned with the solemn warning that,
after the king had pardoned them this time, through
special mercy, for their incautious, thoughtless, and
criminal conduct, they must be very careful not to give
rise to greater suspicion by word or writing, as, in
that case, they would be subjected to a further examination,
and might expect the king's most serious displeasure.</p>

<p>The sovereign lord over the life and death of his subjects
was consequently of a different opinion from the
commissioners, who had found the accused guilty of
no offence. But it was considered desirable to get rid
of those persons most hated, and, in order to convict
them, it was requisite to accuse them of offences at the
expense of truth.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel von Hesselberg, who was referred
to the Commissariat College, learnt there that the king
had appointed him Commander of the 2nd National
Battalion of Schleswig-Holstein. This distinguished
officer afterwards became colonel of an infantry regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
in Norway, where he died in 1808, a lieutenant-general,
and commandant of the fortress of Bergenhuus.</p>

<p>Rear-Admiral Hansen was informed by the Admiralty
that he had forfeited his post as deputy of the
latter college, but would continue to serve the state.
He died a few years after the catastrophe.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Aboe, who also learnt his future fate
from the Admiralty, received orders to pass two years
abroad, but retained his commission and pay. Eventually,
he left the service with the rank of captain, set
up as a merchant in Copenhagen, failed, made voyages
to the East Indies, and died after many hard adventures
in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>The three exiles, Legations-rath Sturtz, Etats-rath
Willebrandt, and Professor Berger, in obedience to the
royal commands, quitted the capital, and proceeded to
their several destinations. When Falckenskjold was
recalled from Switzerland by the crown prince in 1788,
he found Willebrandt still in exile: Berger was a practising
physician at Kiel, but Sturtz had died of grief.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The public of Copenhagen were astonished at this
mild treatment of persons who had been kept in such
close arrest. Much worse had been anticipated. But
three state criminals still remained in prison, and what
had been spared their associates, who were punished
for having been proved innocent, could be done to them.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General von Gähler, Colonel and Chamberlain
von Falckenskjold, and Justiz-rath Struensee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
were still awaiting their sentence. But on May 10
an order had been issued to the commission to lay before
the king a full report of the crimes of these men,
for his Majesty's most gracious consideration and resolution.
In obedience with this command, the commission
sent in its report on May 30.</p>

<p>With respect to Gähler, it was alleged that he was
mixed up both in the Traventhal league and the abolition
of the council. It was true that he had denied
both, but, on the first point, the letters found at his
house contradicted him. As regards the council, he
had not, as his duty ordered, sufficiently represented
the value of the council in his answers to the questions
laid before him for explanation on Sept. 24, 1770,
and there were even strong reasons for conjecturing
that he proposed and promoted the abolition of the
council, because he was Struensee's principal adviser
about this time. In the same way he had recommended
to his friend Struensee, the abolition of the verbal
reports of the colleges. By this, the general had
helped to conceal Struensee's audacious conduct from
the king, and given him, Struensee, opportunity for
filching all the power and authority. It was allowed
that Von Gähler, by his propositions, had no intention
of sustaining Struensee in his situation and promoting
his autocracy. Still, he ought, and must have noticed
Struensee's boundless ambition, when he perceived
that the latter "wished to apply the practice of his
profession to the state, and began by amputating from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
it so important a limb as the council was." General
von Gähler ought the less to have attempted to promote
Struensee's views, as he was not adapted either
by nature or Providence to regulate or remodel a
state. He ought not to have furnished Struensee
with projects, all the consequences of which he could
not foresee. More especially, he ought not to have
advised the suppression of verbal reports, but to have
always opposed it. But he appeared to have been possessed
by a mania for reformation. As a proof, it might
be mentioned that he proposed the reform for which
was introduced into Norway by the regulation of
January 14, 1771, that lands, after ten years' tenure,
should become freehold, which no man of perspicuity
could have advised.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The commission found a second
instance in the reform of the two Chanceries, although
the division of business, according to provinces, had
had the best results.</p>

<p>Before all, however, Von Gähler wished to remodel
the navy. It was quite incredible what tricks he
employed to get it into his hands, and the commission
reports that the misfortune which befel the Algerine
expedition gave Von Gähler the desired opportunity
for effecting it. Herr von Gähler's crime, therefore,
principally consisted in the fact, that he interfered in
everything, and wished to reform all the regulations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of the state, without possessing the requisite knowledge
and insight, without knowing the advantages or
defects of what existed, and without sufficiently pondering
over the consequences of his propositions. The
commission, however, could find no excuse in the circumstance
that Von Gähler's proposed reforms only
consisted of ideas and thoughts, whose trial by experiments
injured nobody, because most of the affairs
in which he interfered in no way concerned him, and
the trouble he took in order to obtain a justification
for doing so, proved a greater offence; for he had
applied to Struensee, a man who was even more ignorant
than himself in such things, and blindly followed
everything that was proposed to him, especially when
such propositions suggested radical changes. The
commission, however, would not omit mentioning that
the general, since May, 1771, had possessed no special
influence over Struensee, because he had joined the
opposition against the reduction of the Horse Guards,
and besides, he had not commended himself to the
cabinet minister, by representing to him how little the
power he had appropriated agreed with the royal law.
Lastly, the general also displayed firmness when the
Foot Guards were disbanded; he had likewise resisted
the removal of the two regiments, and in the Generalty
represented to Chamberlain von Falckenskjold
how improper it was to propose the regiment of the
hereditary prince for such a dislocation, without first
asking whether this would be agreeable to the prince.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The second of the criminal three was Colonel and
Chamberlain von Falckenskjold. According to the
opinion of the commission, he was the man who, next
to Brandt, stood in the closest intimacy with Struensee.
Perhaps, however, Falckenskjold's notorious
dislike of the hereditary prince, and his bold and
manly behaviour in the presence of the commission,
had their share in prejudicing his judges against him,
so that they, through personal hatred, behaved in the
most unscrupulous way toward a man of honour.
Professor Sevel acted as inquisitor, and seemed to find
a pleasure in insulting the fallen friend of Struensee
by all sorts of cruel questions. We can form an idea
of this man's moral value on seeing that Sevel, in his
examination, so far forgot what he owed to himself as
a judge, as to express his regret that Struensee had
not been murdered by the sailors. In their report,
the commissioners first made Falckenskjold's intimacy
with Struensee a capital offence, and asserted that he
had sought to maintain this intimacy so eagerly, because
he and Brandt had received the greatest benefactions
from Struensee. The latter not only conferred
on him offices and honorary posts, but also
gave him money out of the royal treasury.</p>

<p>Thus, Falckenskjold, although on May 2, 1771, he
had received from the cabinet treasury, in payment of
his travelling expenses to Petersburg, the usual sum
of 400 dollars, obtained on the 19th of the same
month 2,000 dollars more, under the same excuse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
from the private treasury, and, after his return, or in
a period of three months, a further sum of 3,500 dollars.
Of these amounts, Struensee paid him 1,000
dollars under the false allegation that Falckenskjold
had spent them on the journey from his private means,
while the 2,000 dollars were paid him without the
king's cognizance. How he had earned these presents,
neither he nor Struensee would have been able
to specify, and the assertion that the king had promised
to pay Von Falckenskjold's debts by degrees,
was only an empty pretext, for the latter had deposited
2,000 dollars with the minister of finances, and
therefore could only have had debts to the amount of
400 dollars; and moreover, he never expressed the
proper thanks to his Majesty for such large gifts in
money. The commission consequently assumed that
Struensee desired to acquire Falckenskjold's gratitude,
and declared in their report that they had
strong grounds for believing that it had been arranged
between the couple, that Struensee should
be supported under all circumstances, and guarded
against any possible surprise, on which Falckenskjold's
own fortunes also depended.</p>

<p>In understanding with Struensee, he proposed the
abolition of the Chevalier guard, and no other had been
more busy than Falckenskjold in setting at work the
cabinet order of December 21. If any event occurred,
and Struensee believed himself in danger, Falckenskjold
was immediately at hand; he had not merely proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
his devotedness to Struensee in this way, but also, for
the sake of pleasing the minister, had neglected the
reverence due to the hereditary prince, and in this
had gone so far that he had furnished proofs of it in
the presence of the entire public. Two facts had
convinced the commission of this daring sentiment of
Falckenskjold, which was based on affection for Struensee,
namely, the removal of the prince's regiment,
and more especially the occurrence on the walls. The
latter event, the commission represented as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the spring of 1771, the prince was, one day,
riding along the walls at the moment when Colonel
Falckenskjold was "exercising" his band, composed of
hautboists and fifers; the colonel blocked the road, and
marched straight upon the prince. Both majors of
the regiment called his attention to the fact, that the
prince was coming toward them; but Falckenskjold
let his men march on. A groom of the prince's now
rode up, and requested room for his royal highness to
pass. The adjutant reported it to the colonel, and
asked whether the band should not leave off playing,
and room be made for the prince? but Falckenskjold
answered: "No, not even if the good God were to
come along Himself." He allowed the band to continue
playing, and the prince, in order to pass, was
compelled to ride close to the parapet.</p>

<p>Falckenskjold alleged, in his excuse, that he had
orders to let the band play in public places, especially
when the king came past, and for this reason there would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
have been an impropriety in his stopping the band on
the arrival of the prince. The colonel also observed
that, in France, where he had served a long time, an
officer was rarely on guard without hearing the sentinel
shout, "<em>Aux armes! le bon Dieu arrive!</em>" when
the Catholic priests passed with the host, and hence it
had grown into a habit to confirm a negative by saying,
"No, I would not do it, even if <em>le bon Dieu</em> were
to come." The commission, however, considered that
this sort of defence contradicted itself, and the colonel
ought certainly to have made way for the prince.</p>

<p>Colonel Falckenskjold's crime, consequently, consisted
in his having sold himself to Struensee, in having
always had an understanding with him, in having advised
the reduction of both Guards, in having expressed
himself for Struensee's conservation, in having given
proofs, on every occasion, how anxious he was that
Struensee should escape a surprise, and lastly, in having
tried, for the sake of pleasing Struensee, to cause
annoyance to his Royal Highness Prince Frederick,
and, for this object, having been so audacious as to
neglect the respect due to his royal highness. Without
dwelling on Falckenskjold's numerous and high services
to the king and country, the commission concluded
their report with the disgraceful statement, that they
could not refrain from seeing in Colonel and Chamberlain
von Falckenskjold a foolhardy, detrimental,
and the more dangerous man, because he would do
anything for money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The third and last upon whom the commission had
to express an opinion was Justiz-rath Struensee. As he
had only been released from his chains by special favour,
after his brother's execution, it might have been expected
that the commission would depict him as a great
criminal. It was quite different, however, though
through no love of truth and justice on the part of the
Inquisition, but in consequence of commands from
higher quarters. For Frederick II. of Prussia, who
had kept Struensee's place, as professor at Liegnitz,
open for him, while he went to try his luck, allowed
his minister, Herr von Arnim, whose tutor Struensee
had been, to employ his master's name in claiming him.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The report on this prisoner of state, after opening
with the statement that Justiz-rath Struensee, though
he only possessed a theoretical knowledge of the laws
and constitution of Denmark, readily accepted a seat as
deputy in the Financial Department, and had the special
inspection of the Mint, the Bank, and the course
of Exchange&mdash;in the hope of obtaining a better knowledge
of these branches of the administration by industry
and work&mdash;acknowledged his irreproachable
conduct in the latter respect, and added the remark,
that the commission could express this with the greater
confidence, as the College of Finances, at their request,
had had the matter examined by an authority on the
subject. As concerned his functions as deputy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
finances generally, however, the commission must blame
Justiz-rath Struensee for a tendency to foolhardy boasting
about services which he had not rendered, and arbitrariness
in financial matters, as he wrote to a friend
that all the others in the Financial College understood
nothing, and eventually strove to become <em>Contrôleur
Général des Finances</em>.</p>

<p>Although, as regarded his official administration
as deputy, there were no positive proofs that he had
abused his charge to the injury of the king and country
for his own interest, yet there was a tolerably strong
presumption that, with the help of his brother and his
office, he wished to render all the subjects in Denmark
tributary to a few Brandenburg partners, who
were to hold the salt and tobacco monopolies, in
exchange for profits promised to him and his brother.
As regards the salt-farming, the commission allowed
that the Justiz-rath had accepted no benefit for himself,
but annually paid over to the king the 10,000
dollars intended for himself. In the matter of the
tobacco-farming, however, some suspicion clung to
him that he, contrary to his brother's advice, accepted
the two shares offered him to promote the affair.
But although, in spite of all Justiz-rath Struensee's
allegations to the contrary, the strongest presumptions
existed against him and his integrity, the commissioners
felt themselves bound to state that it was
not his intention to deprive the Danish tobacco-planters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and spinners of their livelihood, as the farming proposition
was not carried into effect.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>However&mdash;thus runs the forced conclusion of the
report:&mdash;the reports as to the Justiz-rath's former
life in Prussia are generally satisfactory, and he is
honoured with the distinguished favour of Prince
Henry, the brother of Frederick II., who takes a
lively interest in him, and considers him incapable of
any serious crime. Besides, no traces had been found
that the Justiz-rath had intrigued with his brother,
and just as few that he had interfered in things that
did not concern him. Finally, it could not be alleged
as an offence that he received 4,000 dollars from the
private treasury, under the title of gratifications, because
the first 2,000 were given him with the king's
assent, and there was no evidence of his being aware
that the other 2,000 were paid him without the cognizance
of the king.</p>

<p>After the commissioners, probably with a heavy
heart, had closed their report in so mild a way, there
followed, on June 12, 1772, a royal resolution, containing
his Majesty's "will and commands" respecting
the crimes of Lieutenant-General von Gähler, Colonel
and Chamberlain von Falckenskjold, and Justiz-rath
and Deputy of Finances Struensee. The king had
learned from the report of the commissioners that&mdash;</p>

<p>Von Gähler generally undertook to remodel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
reform the whole arrangements of the state, though he
possessed no vocation or knowledge for it; further, that
Von Falckenskjold devoted himself entirely to
Struensee, was joined with him in a portion of his
injurious enterprises, and declared himself in favour
of his conservation, and on all occasions furnished
proof of this, and displayed a further audacious mode
of behaviour; and that, lastly,</p>

<p>Strong presumptions existed against Justiz-rath
Struensee and his honest performance of his duties,
and that he had not fully consulted with the other
persons concerned on matters that came before the
College of Finances.</p>

<p>For this reason, the commission would make known
to Lieutenant-General von Gähler, that, on account of
his thoughtless and improper undertaking, he was dismissed
from the king's service, had forfeited the royal
favour granted him in the decree of March 26, 1767,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
and must at once select a spot in the Danish monarchy&mdash;Seeland,
Fühnen, and Schleswig excepted&mdash;where
he would permanently reside, and commence
his journey to it immediately after leaving the castle.
At the same time, the commission would seriously
warn him, under threats of the royal displeasure, not
to speak or to write about public affairs, as his Majesty,
through special clemency, granted him a pension
of 500 dollars, and the same to his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The commission would demand of Colonel von
Falckenskjold the chamberlain's key and the Russian
order, and announce to him that, in consequence of
his audacious and detrimental behaviour, he would be
conveyed to the fortress of Munkholm, and be imprisoned
there for life, half a dollar a day being allowed
him from the treasury for his support.</p>

<p>Lastly, the commission would announce to Justiz-rath
Struensee that, as he had caused his arrest by
his own suspicious behaviour, he was now released
from it, but he must leave the country at once,
after making a promise, on oath, to reveal neither in
writing nor verbally anything he knew about the
Danish state affairs, and neither to write nor to speak
about the events which had lately occurred in Copenhagen,
and he would also begin his journey immediately
he was released from the castle.</p>

<p>The fate of the three men was very different. Poor
Von Gähler died in exile; Justiz-rath Struensee became
Minister of State in Prussia, where he acquired a considerable
fortune; he was ennobled in 1789 by the
same court of Copenhagen which had his brother's
escutcheon broken by the executioner.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>As for the third person, he shall tell us his story
himself, as it throws such an extraordinary light on
the treatment of state prisoners at a period within a
hundred years of our own.</p>

<p>On June 12, 1772, Sevel, accompanied by the
commandant of the marines and several officers,
entered my prison and told me that the king stripped
me of all my offices and the military order of Russia,
and that I should be transported to a rock and be
detained there for the rest of my days.</p>

<p>The crowd of people who entered with Sevel had so
deafened me, that a portion of what he said escaped
me.</p>

<p>I begged him to repeat how long I was to remain
in detention.</p>

<p><em>For your whole life</em>, he replied, with a grin which I
fancy I can still see.</p>

<p>The commission had doubtless made a report. I
requested the communication of it&mdash;it was refused me.
I was promised a copy of my examination, but was
unable to obtain it.</p>

<p>Thus I was deprived of every document that might
one day be useful in proving my innocence.</p>

<p>On June 26, I was taken on board a merchant
vessel the Admiralty had freighted in order to go to
Munkholm, my place of destination; a sergeant and
four grenadiers of Prince Frederick's regiment, chosen
by Eickstedt, were ordered to guard me on board the
vessel; two grenadiers with drawn sabres were to
watch me and prevent me from speaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>I have since learned that the sergeant commanding
this guard, had a promise of being made lieutenant if
he could induce me to take any step which would
cause me to be landed at Munkholm in chains. But
the skipper had declared to the Admiralty that he
would not allow any one but himself to give orders,
and that if he required the guard, he would summon it.</p>

<p>This worthy man contrived to make himself respected,
and to protect me from ill treatment.</p>

<p>The vessel touched at Christiansund, where a part
of its cargo was to be delivered. A custom-house
clerk came on board and wanted to speak with me.
He wished to insult me, as he had been dismissed in
1763 from his rank of lieutenant; observe, that I
had no part in military affairs till 1771. I heard his
conversation on this subject with the master, who
saved me this annoyance.</p>

<p>The vessel arrived at Munkholm on August 4th,
and I parted, not without regret, from this honest
skipper, who had so generously protected me.</p>

<p>The fort of Munkholm is situated on a barren rock
four hundred paces in circumference, in the middle of
the sea, half a league from Trondhjem,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> toward the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
64° of northern latitude. During the winter it is
covered with an almost continual fog; the snow hardly
remains there eight days in succession; but it freezes
there from the beginning of September, and snow falls
in the month of June.</p>

<p>The only inhabitants of this place consisted of a
detachment of the garrison of Trondhjem, the fort
commandant, the officers under him, and the prisoners
guarded there.</p>

<p>I was lodged in a low room a little above the
ground-floor. Its planks and walls were damp, and
the snow fell into it in a fine rain when it thawed.
Under the window was a cistern of stagnant water;
this lodging, which was also surrounded by the quarters
of the soldiers and the prisoners, whose cries
stunned me, was assuredly not good; but I was alone
in it, had plenty of books, enjoyed the liberty of
walking on the ramparts when I pleased, and I felt
much less unhappy than in Copenhagen; everything
is relative.</p>

<p>I had been warned that the water of the fort was
unhealthy, and produced gravel. I asked if I could
have any other, and they offered me spirits, the
beverage <em>par excellence</em> at this spot, but it was worse
for me than bad water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>I could not procure good bread; old bread, partly
spoiled, was purchased for the prisoners, which cost
12 per cent. less than the ordinary bread. Though
the government had confiscated 8,000 crowns belonging
to me, it only allowed me half-a-crown a day for
my subsistence.</p>

<p>A battalion of the Delmenhorst regiment was in
garrison at Trondhjem; I had served in this regiment,
and found at Munkholm soldiers of a company I had
formerly commanded. They formed a plan for carrying
me off and deserting, but not having been able to
communicate their plan to me, they deserted without
me, and tried to reach Sweden overland; a detachment,
sent in pursuit, caught them and brought them
back.</p>

<p>The solders, generally, were in a profound state of
wretchedness and demoralisation; the spirits and
herrings on which they lived diffused a frightful
stench, and I had a difficulty in protecting myself
against their uncleanliness.</p>

<p>Everything here depended on Lieut.-General von
der Osten, grand bailiff and governor of Trondhjem:
he was said to be fond of presents, and did not hesitate
to ask them, and I had none to offer him. The commandant
of Munkholm, on my arrival, had been a
servant and woodcutter to a Copenhagen tradesman.
He was first a gunner, then non-commissioned officer
in the militia, afterwards a spy, captain of a company
of guides, inspector of an hospital, and, lastly,
commandant of Munkholm. This man, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
extremely brutal and coarse, was frequently intoxicated;
he called himself an atheist, believed himself
an engineer, astronomer, tactician, and decided on
everything without allowing an answer; he declaimed
a great deal, though I could not learn why, against
Counts von Bernstorff and St. Germain.</p>

<p>A poor author, a very pious man, who was placed
here because he had the simplicity to believe in the
freedom of the press, had become, on account of his
devotion, odious to the commandant, who used to beat
him. He also treated very badly another person who
had held a post at court, although the latter made him
presents.</p>

<p>The other officers were given up to the most disgusting
intoxication.</p>

<p>I took great care to avoid these gentlemen, and
only spoke to them when I could not help it. I do
not believe it would have been very difficult for me
to escape from this fortress, and, perhaps, Guldberg
offered me the means by proposing to me a retreat at
Vardohuus,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> under the polar circle. But, I said to
myself, what should I go so far to seek? more injustice
and persecution!</p>

<p>What had been done to me gave me a sort of
disgust for human society. I had wished to render
myself illustrious by arms&mdash;the perusal of the lives of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
celebrated warriors had inflamed my imagination at
an early age. I aspired to become one day the rival
of the Löwendahls and the Münnichs. My studies,
my reflections, were all directed to this object. On
emerging from childhood I took up arms and sought
combats&mdash;I followed this career successfully. I was
summoned to aid in the reformation of my country
and the amelioration of its condition. I quit with
regret the mode of life I had chosen and loved; I
arrive, I consecrate my efforts, all my thoughts to this
new task, and persecution, exile and contumely are
my reward! No, I will not take a single step to
return to society; I was never a man of pleasures,
though not at all insensible to the enjoyments designated
by that name; I shall, doubtless, learn to forget
them. Society has rejected me; they refuse to allow
me any part in its joys and honours, and I have been
relegated to this rock. Well, then, let us perform our
task apart, let us work to render this state supportable,
and to depend on others as little as possible.</p>

<p>I daily confirmed myself in these thoughts&mdash;a
favourite and habitual subject of my reveries&mdash;and
this has decided the rest of my life.</p>

<p>I should be satisfied if I had a healthy lodging, good
water, and if I were not obliged to speak to the people
who surround me.</p>

<p>The taste for study is a great resource for me. I
read a great deal with a pen in my hand; on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
margin of my books I note my souvenirs, my reflections,
and trace the details of the campaigns I have
been through, and develope the considerations I had
sketched about the military condition of Denmark. I
still like to occupy myself with society as a simple
spectator, though I have no desire to act a part in it.
I like to dream awake while walking. The ramparts
are the ordinary scene of my promenades.</p>

<p>Thence, when the weather is fine, I perceive the
mountainous coasts of the mainland, the rocks, the
valleys, the forests, the habitations, which form varied
scenes, the islets and shoals with which the coast is
studded. Sometimes I discern in the distance a vessel
which is, perhaps, bringing me books; more frequently
I watch the departure of the fishermen's boats, or else
see them return, uttering shouts of joy and triumph,
with the booty they have gained by so much fatigue
and boldness in the dangerous Northern Seas.</p>

<p>I also take pleasure in contemplating the fury of the
waves raised by storms, and which break against the
rock on which I am a captive.</p>

<p>In the months of July and August the coast of Norway
offers an aspect of magnificent vegetation; the navigation
is active; clouds of birds appear to animate
the rocks that border the shore; the sky is pure, and
the view enjoyed from Munkholm is enchanting. The
nights, especially, have a peculiar charm; the air has
something unctuous and <em>suave</em>, which seems to soften<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
my melancholy reveries; the nights at this period are
a species of twilight, for at midnight it is clear enough
to read even the finest type.</p>

<p>I have found in an external staircase a spot which
has grown my favourite asylum, even when winter has
commenced. There I am sheltered against the north
winds; there, and in the company of my books, wrapped
up in an old bearskin coat, I feel less a prisoner than
elsewhere; though the eyes of the sentry plunge into
the spot, my presence in it could not be suspected.</p>

<p>Since the commencement of my stay on the island,
I have regulated the employment of my time. I rise
in summer at daybreak, and in winter at eight o'clock.
I employ the first hour of the day in pious meditations;
I then occupy myself with readings that require some
mental effort; a short walk precedes my dinner; I take
a longer walk after the meal. Reading the newspapers,
romances, or theatrical pieces, generally ends
my evenings. The days on which the public papers
arrive are holidays with me. The fort chaplain pays
me a visit now and then: the one who held this office
on my arrival has been removed to Bergen. His conversation
caused me pleasure, and that of his successor
pleases me no less; I have found them both enlightened,
charitable, disposed to relieve me by consolatory
discourses, and by procuring me books. The Danish
clergy, generally, are distinguished from the rest of
the nation by their virtues and information.</p>

<p>When the weather is bad, I walk in a large room in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the tower of the fortress; this room served as a lodging
for Count von Griffenfeldt. He was the son of a
wine-merchant, and rose by his merit to the place of
grand chancellor of the kingdom and the dignity of
count. He governed the state wisely; if he had retained
the power, he would have prevented the wars
that ruined Denmark under Christian V. His enemies
had him condemned to the punishment which the unhappy
Struensee underwent; but on the scaffold itself
the penalty of death, which had been too hasty, was
commuted, as if by mercy, into a confinement on this
rock, where he prolonged his wretchedness for nineteen
years, and died of the gravel.</p>

<p>"Such," I said to myself, "is the fate which menaces
me; but I shall not wait so long for it, for I believe
that I can already feel the same malady."</p>

<p>In October, 1774, the marriage festival of Prince
Frederick was celebrated, and at this very period a
despatch arrived for the commandant of Munkholm.
He was recommended greater severity with his prisoners,
and especially with me. This letter of General
Hauch's was certainly not written with the intention
of my seeing it, but it was shown me by the commandant.
His attentions to me did not escape my
notice; he, doubtless, wished to make me feel them;
what did he expect from me?</p>

<p>On March 1, 1775, a lodging was assigned me in
another house, which had just been finished. I was
given two rooms, but did not gain by the change.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
The other buildings of the fort, and in particular the
one I had inhabited, were sheltered by the ramparts,
while the new house, built in the angle of a lofty rock,
was exposed to the north, east, and west winds. The
beams that formed the walls did not join, any more
than the planks of the floor; under my lodging a cellar
seemed to breathe an icy blast through the openings
in the flooring. The stove intended to heat the room
could not protect me from the cold; yet its effect was
sufficient when the snow fell to dissolve it into rain
in the apartment; and it is in such a habitation, under
the 64° of northern latitude, that I write this description,
which is not exaggerated.</p>

<p>In November, 1775, I was attacked by an hemorrhoidal
colic, which caused me such pain as to draw
shrieks from me. The surgeon who attended me evidently
thought my condition desperate. The pain
grew less, however; I needed rest, and begged the
sentry not to let any one enter. I was beginning to
sleep, when the commandant arrived; he entered in
defiance of my orders, woke me, and said that as I was
on the point of death, I ought to make haste, and leave
a will in his favour; I evaded this by answering him
that I did not intend dying yet. He assured me again
that I must believe him, because he was commandant:
I made no answer, and he went off growling, and soon
after made a frightful disturbance, alleging that an
attempt was going to be made to carry me off, and
that a boat had been noticed in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in 1776, the commandant of Munkholm was
removed, and Major Colin took his place.</p>

<p>This new commandant, two days after his arrival,
sent me a bottle of good water, bread, and fresh
butter; this procured me the best meal I had yet
had. Under this commandant I enjoyed great tranquility
and greater ease. I relieved myself by writing
these memoirs, and I fancied that I felt less
resentment at the evil that had been done me, in
proportion as I wrote the narrative of it.</p>

<p>It is certain that fate has been very contrary to me.
I joined to the passion of arms a taste for meditation,
study, and retirement. I eagerly desired to acquire
glory, but an independence would have been sufficient
for me: I could not hope for either now.</p>

<p>Some one once said to Count de St. Germain, that
it was surprising he should resolve to quit the service
of France, when he had 60,000 livres a year from the
king's bounty; he answered, that 100 crowns a year
composed his whole patrimony, but he would sooner
live on that than endure affronts.</p>

<p>This answer struck me, and I resolved to save all I
could, so as to acquire an independence. I possessed,
in 1771, 8,000 crowns, which I had entrusted to
Schimmelmann, while awaiting the opportunity to sink
them in an annuity. If I did not succeed in a military
career, I hoped with this resource to procure
a retreat in an agreeable country, and in a warm
climate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, my money is lost, I have no longer a career
to follow, and I am a prisoner for life on a rock in
64° of northern latitude: but how great was my
folly in leaving the service of Russia to come to
Denmark!</p>

<p>I was making these sad reflections when, on September
25, 1776, I was informed by a note from
Lieutenant-General von der Osten, grand bailiff and
commandant of Trondhjem, that I should receive a
visit from him. I had not recovered from the surprise
this note caused me, when Von der Osten himself
appeared, followed by the commandant, a surgeon,
and his valet. He hurriedly entered my room,
shouting, <em>Pardon, pardon, in the king's name!</em> He
held in his hand a portfolio full of papers, among
which were&mdash;</p>

<p>1. An order for my release, addressed to General
Hauch, in his quality of first deputy of the College of
War: this order was signed by the king, and countersigned
by Guldberg, under date, Frederiksborg, August
21, 1776.</p>

<p>2. An order to the same effect, addressed to the
commandant of Munkholm.</p>

<p>3. An instruction referring to the engagement I
was to sign and seal before obtaining my release.</p>

<p>These three documents were to the effect that his
Majesty, on the intercession of his Royal Highness
Prince Frederick, his beloved brother, consented to
pardon me by liberating me from the captivity in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
which I was at Munkholm, upon the following conditions:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. That I should leave Trondhjem by sea, to proceed
to the northern coast of France, and thence directly
and immediately either to Provence or Languedoc,
at my choice.</p>

<p>II. That I would pledge myself never to return to
Copenhagen, or the king's states.</p>

<p>III. That I would not leave the country to which
I was sent without the king's permission, and that
I would not make frequent journeys.</p>

<p>IV. That I would not approach the town of Orange
(where Rantzau had taken up his abode).</p>

<p>V. That I would not enter the service of any foreign
power.</p>

<p>VI. That I would not act, write, or speak in any
way against the king or the royal family.</p>

<p>VII. That I would take no part in affairs of state.</p>

<p>If there was no vessel ready for me to embark,
I was allowed to remain at Trondhjem; but I must
not leave the town without the governor's permission,
or go further than a league from it. The king granted
me for my journey 800 crowns of the money which
had belonged to me, and hopes were held out of a
pension.</p>

<p>The instruction concerning my engagement was
very long. Guldberg, who had drawn it up, had
interlarded it with a good many religious motives: he
even alluded to the efficaciousness of Christ's blood;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
but, after all, it was probably to him that I owed the
amelioration in my fate.</p>

<p>General von der Osten added to the conditions
various articles, by which he hoped to pay court to
the minister.</p>

<p>I signed what was asked, and though I felt perfectly
well the value of an engagement imposed on a
man who had not been legally convicted of any crime,
I resolved to observe it. When this act was regularly
drawn up, the general, in order to give the circumstance
greater <em>éclat</em>, had me bled by his surgeon-major,
after which he proposed to me a bottle of red
wine to restore my senses.</p>

<p>I excused myself by observing that I did not drink,
and offered him a liqueur, of which I possessed two
bottles.</p>

<p>"I could carry them off," he said, after examining
them; "but this commission must be worth more than
that."</p>

<p>This was giving me to understand that he reckoned
on a goodly portion of my 800 crowns. It may be supposed
that my intentions on this point did not at all
accord with his.</p>

<p>There was no vessel at Trondhjem destined for
France, and I could not expect one for a long time,
as from the beginning of September till the end of
April the sea is very stormy in these latitudes, and
hence I should have to wait eight full months before I
could depart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>In this situation I wrote to the court to offer my
thanks for the mercy shown me, and to obtain permission
to proceed to my destination by land. In the
meanwhile I remained at Munkholm, hoping to be less
exposed there to the importunities of the general.
The court of Copenhagen rejected my request, but
allowed me to take ship for Holland.</p>

<p>Three vessels were preparing to sail for Amsterdam,
one of which belonged to Trondhjem, and General von
der Osten wished me to take passage in it; but I gave
the preference to a Danish ship.</p>

<p>The general offered me the services of his valet, to
prepare a gold-laced coat; but this offer did not tempt
me. I set out with my bearskin pelisse, which composed
my wardrobe. I also carried off my 800 crowns,
without leaving one for the general.</p>

<p>The three vessels bound for Amsterdam set sail
from Trondhjem on October 16; two perished: the
one I was on board reached Christiansund, where we
remained till February 16. After a stormy navigation,
we reached Amsterdam on March 10.</p>

<p>On April 12, 1777, I arrived at Montpellier, where
I fixed my domicile.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In 1780, Falckenskjold received permission to retire
to the Pays de Vaud, where his friend Reverdil
invited him, and he established his home at Lausanne.
In 1787, the court of Petersburg proposed to him to
re-enter its service; he was offered the post of chief of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the staff in the army intended to act against the Turks.
But, finding himself bound by the engagements he had
made, he replied, that he could not accept the offer
without the formal consent of the court of Copenhagen;
and this court refused its assent, under the
pretext that it needed his services. At the same
time, it permitted Falckenskjold to return to Copenhagen,
and seemed disposed to revoke his order of
banishment.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1788 he went to Copenhagen, but
his reception there was such that he longed to return
to his retreat at Lausanne. He obtained permission to
go back, and, having recovered a portion of his property,
which the state had seized, he invested it in
annuities in the French funds. In the same year,
war having broken out between Denmark and Sweden,
the Danish government recalled Falckenskjold, conferring
on him the rank and pay of a major-general;
but when he was going to set out he learned that
peace was signed, and he was saved the journey.</p>

<p>His pay and savings enabled him to live comfortably,
with such friends as Gibbon and Reverdil; and
he kept his health till the last two years of his life,
when he was attacked by a gouty rheumatism, the
seeds of which he had contracted in his Munkholm
prison. He died on September 30, 1820, at the age
of eighty-two years and a few months.</p>

<p>We have seen that the sentence of the court, decreeing
a dissolution of the marriage, was announced to Caroline
Matilda. From this moment she was no longer regarded
as queen, and all her ties with Denmark were
broken off with her marriage. After her condemnation,
the ambassadors of the foreign powers were convoked
at the Christiansborg Palace. They proceeded thither
in mourning, and heard from the grand-master that,
as the king no longer had a consort, there was no
longer a queen. The name of Caroline Matilda was
from this moment effaced from the public prayers.
She became a stranger to the country over which she
had reigned.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>As was the case with the other prisoners, whose
position was considerably mitigated so soon as they
had made satisfactory confessions in their examination
before the Commission of Inquiry, the queen, after
the separation, was granted better apartments in the
first-floor of the fortress, and was allowed to take the
air on the ramparts. That Colonel Keith was permitted
to visit the queen was looked on as a further
concession, and that the envoy frequently took advantage
of this permission, may surely be regarded as
a further and important proof how greatly he was
convinced of her innocence.</p>

<p>When her Majesty was informed of the circumstances
connected with the tragical death of the two prisoners,
she said to Fräulein Mösting, her maid of honour,</p>

<p>"Unhappy men! they have paid dearly for their attachment
to the king, and their zeal for my service."</p>

<p>No thought of self, it will be noticed: Caroline
Matilda entirely forgot the humiliation to which she
had been exposed by Struensee's dastardly confession,
and only evinced sincere compassion for his undeserved
and barbarous fate. But she was ever thus: from the
first moment to the last, she sacrificed herself for others.
Of this, the following anecdote will serve as an affecting
proof:&mdash;</p>

<p>The queen, having so fatally experienced the vicissitudes
of human grandeur, was not so deeply affected
by her own disasters as to overlook the sufferings and
misery of some state prisoners, doomed to perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
exile in the Castle of Kronborg. Her Majesty's liberal
beneficence was never more conspicuous than in this
period of affliction and distress. She sent daily from
her table two dishes to these forsaken objects of compassion,
and out of a scanty allowance, she sent, weekly,
a small sum to be distributed among them. The
governor having requested her Majesty to withdraw
her bounty from an officer who had been closely confined
for some years past in a remote turret, debarred
from all human intercourse, on suspicion of a treasonable
correspondence with the agent of a northern power,
who had enlisted, with the assistance of the prisoner,
several Danish subjects for his master's service, the
queen merely replied with the following line of Voltaire:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"Il suffit qu'il soit homme et qu'il soit malheureux."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>On one occasion, Caroline Matilda, conversing on the
early commencement of her misfortunes, observed that,
since she was born to suffer, she found some consolation
in being marked out so soon by the hand of adversity.
"I may possibly live," said her Majesty, "to see
Denmark disabused with respect to my conduct:
whereas my poor mother, one of the best women that
ever existed, died while the load of obloquy lay heavy
upon her, and went to the grave without the pleasure
of a vindicated character."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in March, the charges against Caroline Matilda
had been forwarded to London, and were there
submitted to the opinions of the first lawyers, who,
though consulted separately, all declared that the evidence
brought forward was so far from being legal conviction,
that it scarce amounted to a bare presumption
of guilt: and they affirmed that they did not give credit
to any of the facts as lawyers, but even found themselves
obliged to disbelieve them as men. Upon this the
court of St. James insisted that no sentence should be
passed on her Danish Majesty, as the evidence against
her was only presumptive, and very inconclusive.</p>

<p>A strong fleet was now fitted out, and universally
supposed to be destined for the Baltic; still the most
prudent thought, or at least hoped, that the fleet was
only intended to intimidate the Danes, but would not
sail, as the king of Prussia would certainly march an
army immediately to Hanover, and then a new war
would be kindled in the north. On the 22nd, counter
orders, for suspending the preparations, were sent to
Portsmouth. Horace Walpole, the omniscient, shall
tell us what was the generally accepted version of the
affair:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The king, as Lord Hertford told me, had certainly
ordered the fleet to sail; and a near relation of Lord
North told me that the latter had not been acquainted
with that intention. Lord Mansfield, therefore, who
had now got the king's ear, or Lord Sandwich, First
Lord of the Admiralty, must have been consulted.
The latter, though I should think he would not ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>prove
it, was capable of flattering the king's wishes:
Lord Mansfield assuredly would. The destination was
changed on the arrival of a courier from Denmark, who
brought word that the queen was repudiated, and, I
suppose, a promise that her life should be spared: for,
though the Danes had thirty ships and the best seamen,
next to ours, and though we were sending but
ten against them, the governing party were alarmed,
probably from not being sure their nation was with
them. The queen had confessed her intrigue with
Struensee, and signed that confession. When the
counsellor, who was to defend her, went to receive her
orders, she laughed, and told him the story was true."</p>

<p>In this we have a favourable specimen of Walpole's
talent as an embroiderer of history. It is very evident
that he had heard the facts floating about society; but
his additions to them were evidently pure inventions.
He shall give us one bit more of gossip, which may or
may not have been true, although there appears to be
evidence in its favour in the strange conduct of George
III. toward his sister:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They gave her (Caroline Matilda) the title of
Countess of Aalborg, and condemned her to be shut
up in the castle of that name. The King of England
had certainly known her story two years before. A
clerk in the secretary's office having opened a letter
that came with the account, told me that he had seen
it before the secretaries gave it to the king. It was
now believed that this intelligence had occasioned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Princess of Wales to make her extraordinary journey
to Germany, where she saw her daughter, though to
no purpose. Princess Amelia told Lord Hertford, on
the 26th, that when the King of Denmark was in
England, observing how coldly he spoke of his wife,
she asked him why he did not like her. He answered,
'Mais elle est si blonde!' The princess added, that
Queen Matilda had a very high spirit, and that she believed
the Danes would consent to let her go to Hanover.
'But she will not be let go thither,' added the princess,
meaning that the queen's brother, Prince Charles
of Mecklenburg, commanded there, 'or to Zell, but
she will not go thither (another of the queen's
brothers was there); perhaps she <em>may</em> go to Lüneburg."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>It is very probable, too, that the temper of the
British nation, which had undergone a complete revulsion
on the announcement of the fleet sailing, had
something to do with its suspension. At any rate,
we read in the <em>General Evening Post</em> for April 30, the
following painful account:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nothing, surely, is a greater impeachment of our
laws, and more, of our lawgivers and magistrates,
than the unrestrained licentiousness daily exhibited
by the common people in this metropolis. Yesterday,
in some parts of the city, men were crying about
printed papers containing the most scandalous, ruinous,
and impudent reflections on the Queen of Denmark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
The worst prostitute that ever Covent Garden
produced could not have had more gross abuse
bestowed on her."</p>

<p>But Sir R. M. Keith had been working hard in the
meanwhile, and on the receipt of his letters of recall
and news of the menaces of England in equipping a
fleet, the regency gave in at once, promised to repay
the queen's dowry, allow her five thousand a-year, and
let her go to Hanover, beyond Jordan, anywhere, so
long as they could only be rid of her. In reply to
the despatch in which Sir R. M. Keith announced his
success, he received the following official letter:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">L<span class="smcap">ORD</span> S<span class="smcap">UFFOLK TO</span> S<span class="smcap">IR</span> R. M. K<span class="smcap">EITH</span>.<br />

<span class="mleft8"><em>St. James's, May</em> 1, 1772.</span></p>

<p>S<span class="smcap">IR</span>,</p>

<p>Your despatches by King the messenger have
been already acknowledged; those by Pearson were
received on Wednesday afternoon, and I now answer
both together.</p>

<p>His Majesty's entire approbation of your conduct
continues to the last moment of your success, and his
satisfaction has in no part of it been more complete
than in the manner in which you have stated, urged,
and obtained the liberty of his sister. The care you
have taken to distinguish between a claim of right
and the subjects of negotiation, and to prevent the
mixture of stipulations with a demand, is perfectly
agreeable to your instructions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The national object of procuring the liberty of a
daughter of England confined in Denmark, after her
connection with Denmark was dissolved, is now obtained.
For this alone an armament was prepared,
and therefore, as soon as the acquiescence of the court
of Copenhagen was known, the preparations were
suspended, that the mercantile and marine interests
of this kingdom might be affected no longer than was
necessary by the expectation of a war.</p>

<p>Instead of a hostile armament, two frigates and a
sloop of war are now ordered to Elsinore. One of
these is already in the Downs&mdash;the others will repair
thither immediately; and, so soon as the wind permits,
they will proceed to their destination. I enclose
to you an account of them, which you may transmit
to Monsieur Ostein (Von der Osten) ministerially,
referring at the same time to the assurance of these
pacific proceedings.</p>

<p>The compliance of the Danish court with his Majesty's
demand is still a compliance. Their continuing,
unasked, the title of queen, and other concessions,
and the attainment of the national object accompanying
each other, his Majesty would think it improper
to interrupt the national intercourse from any personal
or domestic consideration. You will therefore inform
Mr. Ostein that his Majesty intends to leave a minister
at the court of Copenhagen, the explanation you
may give of this suspension of former directions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and his determination, being left to your own discretion.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>It was with feelings of pride that the British envoy
passed through the vaulted entrance of "Hamlet's
Castle," to carry to an afflicted and injured princess
the welcome proofs of fraternal affection and liberty
restored. The feeling was reciprocal, for when Keith
brought the order for Caroline Matilda's enlargement,
which he had obtained by his spirited conduct, she
was so surprised by the unexpected intelligence, that
she burst into a flood of tears, embraced him in a
transport of joy, and called him her deliverer.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The queen from this time forth was more constantly
than ever on the ramparts watching for the arrival
of the British flotilla. The squadron, consisting of
the <em>Southampton</em>, Captain McBride, the <em>Seaford</em>, Captain
Davis, and the <em>Cruizer</em>, Captain Cummings, left
England on May 22, and anchored off Elsinore on
the 27th. In the meanwhile Caroline Matilda wrote
her brother a most affecting letter, asserting her innocence
of all the criminal accusations against her in the
strongest manner, and declaring that the strictness of
her future life should fully refute the slander of her
enemies. She at the same time expressed a wish to
be allowed to return to England, but left her fate in
his Majesty's hands. A consultation had been held at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Buckingham House on the subject, but it was found
too expensive, and it was finally settled that Caroline
Matilda was to take up her residence at Celle, in
Hanover, George III. allowing her £8,000 a year for
the support of her dignity.</p>

<p>Very touching, too, is it to read that the queen at
this time wore nothing but deep mourning; and one
of her ladies asking her why she affected such a semblance
of sorrow, she replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a debt I owe to my murdered reputation."</p>

<p>Sir Robert Murray Keith supplies an interesting
anecdote of the queen in a letter to his sister:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here I am, thank my stars, upon the utmost verge
of Denmark. My ships are not yet arrived, but a few
days may conclude the whole affair; and the weather
is mild and agreeable. I return to Copenhagen this
evening, but only for a day or two, to wind up my
affairs, and give my parting advice to the little secretary,
in whose success as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chargé d'affaires</i> I take a
particular interest. I am just returned from her
Majesty, who is, Heaven be praised, in perfect health,
notwithstanding the danger she has run of catching
the measles from the young princess, whom she never
quitted during her illness. A more tender mother
than this queen has never been born in the world."</p>

<p>Caroline Matilda was at dinner when the imperial
salute of the English frigate and the castle guns informed
her Majesty of Captain McBride's arrival.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
This gallant officer met Sir R. Keith on shore, who,
after a mutual exchange of compliments, introduced
the captain to her Majesty, by whom he was most
graciously received as a man destined to convey her
safe to her brother's electoral dominions; far from the
reach of the personal shafts of her enemies, and that
land which had been the dismal scene of her unparalleled
misfortunes and humiliations. When the
captain had notified his commission, and said that he
should await her Majesty's time and pleasure, she
exclaimed in the anguish of her heart, "Ah! my
dear children," and immediately retired. It was not
for an insensible monarch on a throne, on which she
seemed to have been seated merely to be the butt of
envy, malice, and perfidy, that her Majesty grieved:
the excruciating idea of being parted from her dear
children, and the uncertainty of their fate, summoned
up all the feelings of a tender mother. She begged
to see her son before he was torn for ever from her
bosom: but all her Majesty's entreaties were unsuccessful.
Juliana Maria envied her the comfort of the
most wretched&mdash;that of a parent sympathising in mutual
grief and fondness with children snatched from
her embrace by unnatural authority.</p>

<p>A deputation of noblemen having been appointed
by the queen dowager to observe the queen after her
enlargement till her departure, under the fallacious
show of respect for the royal personage so lately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
injured and degraded&mdash;when they were admitted to
Caroline Matilda's presence, and wished her in her
Majesty's name a happy voyage, she answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"The time will come when the king will know
that he has been deceived and betrayed; calumny may
impose for a time on weak and credulous minds, but
truth always prevails in the end. All my care and
anxiety are now for the royal infants, my children."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>On May 30, a lady belonging to the court went
to Kronborg in one of the king's coaches to remove
the young Princess Louisa Augusta, and conduct her
royal highness to Christiansborg Palace. Hence the
last moments which the feeling queen spent in Denmark
were the most painful of all: she was obliged to
part from her only consolation, her only blessing, her
beloved daughter: she was forced to leave her dear
child among her enemies. For a long time she bedewed
the infant with hot tears&mdash;for a long time she
pressed it to her heart. She strove to tear herself
away; but the looks, the smiles, the endearing movements
of the infant, were so many fetters to hold the
affectionate mother back. At last she called up all
her resolution, took her once more in her arms, with
the impetuous ardour of distracted love imprinted on
the lips of the child the farewell kiss, and, delivering it
to the lady-in-waiting, shrieked, "Away, away, I now
possess nothing here!"<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>As the governor had behaved to the queen so as to
merit her Majesty's confidence and esteem, she entrusted
him with a letter for the king, which he promised
faithfully to deliver into his Majesty's own
hands. It must have been very moving, as the king
was observed to shed tears on reading it.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>At six in the evening of May 30, Caroline Matilda
proceeded in a royal Danish boat on board the English
frigate. Her suite consisted of Colonel Keith, who
would accompany her to Göhrde, and of Count Holstein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
zu Ledreborg, his wife, Lady-in-waiting von
Mösting, and Page of the Chamber von Raben, who
were ordered to convey her Majesty as far as Stade,
and then return by land. When the anchor was
apeak, the fortress, and the Danish guardship in the
Sound, gave a salute of twenty-seven guns.</p>

<p>The queen remained on deck, her eyes immovably
directed toward the fortress of Kronborg, which contained
her child, who had so long been her only source
of comfort, until darkness intercepted the view. The
vessel having made but little way during the night,
at daybreak she observed with fond satisfaction that
the fortress was still visible, and could not be persuaded
to enter the cabin so long as she could obtain
the faintest glimpse of the battlements.</p>

<p>Among Sir R. M. Keith's papers was found the
following copy of verses, whose title speaks for itself.
Unfortunately, there is no positive proof that they
were written by the queen herself, beyond the care
that Sir Robert took of them:&mdash;</p>

<p>Before taking leave of Kronborg, I may be permitted
to insert an anecdote related by my grandfather in his
"Travels in the North." When he visited Kronborg,
in 1774, a poor fettered slave came up and addressed
him in French. Mr. Wraxall then commenced a conversation
with him, and asked him if he were here
when Queen Matilda was in confinement.</p>

<p>"Ah! Monsieur," the prisoner replied, "I saw her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
every day. I had the honour to turn the spit for her
Majesty's dinner. She even promised to endeavour
to obtain me my liberty. I assure you," he added
warmly, "that she was the most amiable princess in
the world."</p>

<p>Whether the man said this because he believed it
would please an Englishman, or whether it was the
genuine effusion of respectful gratitude, my grandfather
was unable to say, but could not resist the compliment
to an English and injured queen.</p>

<p>By a royal resolution of March 18, 1773, all the
documents connected with the dissolution of the marriage
of Queen Caroline Matilda were made into four
separate packets, and one of them, which contained the
orders, protocols, and examinations, was deposited in
the secret archives: the second, containing the perfect
acts with the votes of all the commissioners, and a copy
of the examination of the witnesses, was entrusted for
safe keeping to the governor of Glückstadt: the third,
consisting of a copy of the original articles and the
examinations, was kept at the Norwegian fortress of
Bergenhuus, in an iron chest, in a room the keys of
which were held by the commandant and the viceroy:
and the fourth packet, which only contained a copy of
the articles, but not of the depositions, was placed in
the archives of the Danish Chancery. This division
of the documents also serves as a proof, how every
possible care was taken that the queen's posterity
should not hereafter find the whole of the documents
at any one place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The queen did not reach Stade till June 5, where
she was received with all the respect due to crowned
heads. The Hanoverian Privy Councillor von Bodenhausen,
and the Land Marshal Chamberlain von Bülow,
pulled on board the flag-ship to welcome the queen.
At the landing-place, where the ladies and gentlemen
selected to attend on her Majesty were awaiting her,
the Danish escort took leave. The queen gave Count
Holstein a diamond solitaire as a souvenir, and entrusted
him with a gold snuff-box for the wife of General
von Hauch, commandant of Kronborg.</p>

<p>The new suite of the queen was composed of a
grand lady, two ladies-in-waiting, one chief chamberlain,
a chamberlain, one page of the bed-chamber, two
pages and a number of servants. After remaining for
two days at Stade, she travelled with her suite, <em>viâ</em>
Harburg, to the Château of Göhrde, thirty miles from
Stade, where she intended to remain till the palace at
Celle was restored for her reception. At Göhrde,
Sir R. Keith took leave of her, and she received a
visit from her eldest sister, the Hereditary Princess of
Brunswick Wolfenbüttel and her husband.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> These
near relations, however, also belonged to the princely
family from which Juliana Maria was descended, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
in consequence, were rather suspicious friends for
Caroline Matilda.</p>

<p>On October 20, the queen made her entrance into
Celle, and took up her abode in the royal château.
This old residence of the former Dukes of Lüneburg
was at this time a fortified castle surrounded by moats
and walls. Although the apartments were spacious
and habitable, and well furnished, the exterior of the
castle resembled a prison rather than a palace. But
the queen soon gained the hearts of all the inhabitants
by her amiability and resignation, and thus converted
the unfriendly asylum into an abode of peace and consolation.
She frequently attended at church, was fond
of conversing on religious topics, and gave rich gifts to
the poor, both with her own hands and through the
clergy of the town. Treating all gracefully who
approached her presence, she more especially gave
children an opportunity of telling their parents, with
delight, that they had been spoken to by the queen.
If, at night, she fancied she had not been so friendly
as usual to any one during the day, she reproached
herself for it. Judging all persons indulgently, she
could not endure that absent persons should be harshly
condemned in her presence, and, in truth, she ruled her
court, not alone by her rank, but even more through the
lovingness of her noble heart. But, whenever she was
obliged to act the queen, she did so, on the other hand,
with a dignified demeanour and with majesty.</p>

<p>Although Caroline Matilda excelled in all the exer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>cises
befitting her sex, birth, and station, and danced
the first minuet in the Danish court, she never again
indulged in this polite amusement, of which she had
been extremely fond, after the masked ball the conclusion
of which had been so fatal and disgraceful to
her Majesty. As one of her pretended crimes had
been the delight she took in riding, and the uncommon
address and spirit with which she managed her horse,
she also renounced this innocent recreation, for fear of
giving the least occasion to the blame and malice of
the censorious and the ignorant. Her Majesty had an
exquisite taste for music, and devoted much of her
time to the harpsichord, accompanied by the melodious
voice of a lady of her court.</p>

<p>There was in the queen's dress a noble simplicity
which exhibited more taste than magnificence. As
her mind had been cultivated by reading the most
eminent writers of modern times, she read regularly for
two hours before dinner with Fräulein Schülenburg,
whatever her Majesty thought most conducive to her
instruction or entertainment, in poetry and history,
the ladies communicating their observations to each
other with equal freedom and ingenuity. The queen
improved the knowledge she had acquired of the
German language, and had a selection of the best
authors of that learned nation. As her manners were
the most polished, graceful, and endearing, her court
became the resort of persons of both sexes, celebrated
for their love of the fine arts. The contracted state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of her finances could not restrain the princely magnificence
and liberal disposition which made her purse
ever open to indigent merit and distressed virtue.
Naturally cheerful and happy in the consciousness of
her innocence, adored and revered by the circle of a
court free from cabals and intrigues, even the dark
cloud of adversity could not alter the sweetness and
serenity of her temper. She was surrounded by
faithful servants, who attended her, not from sordid
motives of ambition, but from attachment and unfeigned
regard.</p>

<p>Peace, content, and harmony dwelt under her Majesty's
auspices, and her household was like a well-regulated
family, superintended by a mistress who
made her happiness consist in doing good to all those
who implored her Majesty's compassion and benevolence.
Banished with every circumstance of indignity
from the throne of Denmark, her noble soul retained
no sentiment of revenge or resentment against
the wicked authors of her fall, or against the Danish
people. Ambition, a passion from which she was singularly
exempt, never disturbed her peace of mind;
and she looked back to the diadem which had been
torn from her brow with wondrous calmness and magnanimity.</p>

<p>It was not the crown Caroline Matilda regretted,
for her children alone occupied all her care and solicitude;
the feelings of the queen were absorbed in
those of the mother; and if she ever manifested by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
tears her inward grief and perplexity, maternal fondness
caused all these fears and agitations.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>In October of this year Sir R. Keith was requested
by Lord Suffolk to visit Caroline Matilda, and send in
a minute account of her position and feelings. How
well the ambassador performed his task will be seen
from his letter.</p>

<p>M<span class="smcap">Y</span> L<span class="smcap">ORD</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>I arrived here on the 31st October, late in the
evening, and the next day had the honour of delivering
the king's letter to her Danish Majesty, whom I
found in perfect health, and without any remains of
pain from her late accident. In two very long audiences,
which her Majesty was pleased to grant me, I
endeavoured to execute, with the utmost punctuality,
his Majesty's command, and shall now lay before your
lordship all the lights those audiences afforded me,
relative to the queen's wishes and intentions. I cannot
enter upon that subject without previously assuring
your lordship that the queen received those repeated
proofs of his Majesty's fraternal affection and friendship,
which my orders contained, with the warmest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>expressions of gratitude and sensibility; and that nothing
could be more frank or explicit than her answers
to a great number of questions, which she permitted
me to ask upon any subject that arose.</p>

<p>In regard to Denmark, the queen declares that, in
the present situation of the court, she has not a wish
for any correspondence or connection there, beyond
what immediately concerns the welfare and education
of her children. That she has never written a single
letter to Denmark since she left it, or received one
thence. That the only person belonging to that kingdom
from whom she hears lives in Holstein, and is not
connected with the court.</p>

<p>The queen having expressed great anxiety with
respect to the false impressions which may be instilled
into the minds of her children, particularly regarding
herself, I thought it my duty to say that
such impressions, however cruelly intended, could not,
at the tender age of her Majesty's children, nor for
some years to come, take so deep a root as not to be
entirely effaced by more candid instructions, and the
dictates of filial duty, when reason and reflection shall
break in upon their minds. The queen seemed willing
to lay hold of that hope, yet could not help bursting
into tears, when she mentioned the danger of losing
the affections of her children.</p>

<p>Her Majesty appears very desirous to communicate
directly to her royal brother all her views and wishes
in the most confidential manner, hoping to obtain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
return his Majesty's advice and directions, which she
intends implicitly to follow. She said that, in matters
of so private and domestic a nature, it would give her
much greater pleasure to learn his Majesty's intentions
upon every point from his own pen, than through
the channel of any of his electoral servants.</p>

<p>It gave me great satisfaction to find her Majesty in
very good spirits, and so much pleased with the palace
at Zell, the apartments of which are very spacious, and
handsomely furnished. She wishes to have an apartment
fitted up in the palace for her sister, the Princess
of Brunswick, as she thinks that the etiquette of
this country does not permit that princess, in her visits
to Zell, to be lodged out of the palace, without great
impropriety. Her Majesty said that she intended to
write herself to the king on this head.</p>

<p>The queen told me that the very enterprising and
dangerous part which Queen Juliana has acted in
Denmark, has created greater astonishment in Brunswick
(where the abilities and character of that princess
are known) than, perhaps, in any other city of
Europe.</p>

<p>Her Majesty talked to me of several late incidents at
the court of Denmark, but without appearing to take
much concern in them. She mentioned, with a smile,
some of the paltry things which had been sent as a part
of her baggage from Denmark, adding, that this new
instance of their meanness had not surprised her.
But the Princess of Brunswick, who happened to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
present when the baggage was opened, expressed her
indignation at the treatment in such strong terms,
that she (the queen) could not help taking notice of
it in her letters to the king.</p>

<p>She let me understand that a small collection of
English books would be very agreeable to her, leaving
the choice of them entirely to his Majesty.</p>

<p>Her Majesty more than once expressed how much
she considered herself obliged to the king's ministers,
for the zeal they had shown in the whole of the late
unhappy transactions relating to Denmark and to herself.
She is particularly sensible to the great share
your lordship had in all those affairs, and has commanded
me to convey to your lordship her acknowledgments
for that constant attention to her honour
and interests, which she is persuaded the king will
look upon as an additional mark of your lordship's
dutiful attachment to his royal person and family.</p>

<p>It only remains that I should beg your forgiveness
for the great length to which I have swelled this
letter. The only excuse I can offer arises from my
ardent desire to excuse the king's orders with the
utmost possible precision.</p>

<p>At home, Caroline Matilda appeared to have dropped
out of memory with her landing at Stade. Her name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>is never found in the journals of the time. Grub-street
alone took possession of her memory. In those
days many literary scoundrels earned a precarious
livelihood by deliberately forging pamphlets on topics
of interest at the moment, and thought nothing of
trying to enhance their veracity by assuming names
and titles to which they had not the slightest claim.
One of these hungry gentry received a severe discomfiture,
and must have felt ashamed, if he could feel
shame, from honest Reverdil, in the July number of
the <cite>Monthly Review</cite>. Reverdil's letter, written in
English, is tremendously to the point. The lie, with
a circumstance, bore the title of&mdash;"The real Views and
Political System of the late Revolution of Copenhagen.
By Christian Adolphus Rothes, formerly Councillor
of Conference, Secretary of the Cabinet to his Majesty
Christiern (<em>sic</em>) VII., and Great Assessor of the Supreme
Council at Altona."</p>

<p>To which Reverdil quietly makes answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. As I am pretty well acquainted with the Danish
service, I can assure you that there is not in Denmark,
Norway, or any of the Danish dominions, such a man
as Mr. Christian Adolphus Rothes, in any employment
whatever.</p>

<p>2. The dignity of Councillor of Conference being
merely titular, there is no <em>formerly</em> Councillor.</p>

<p>3. The present king, Christian VII., has had three
secretaries of the cabinet: the first is now in London
(himself); the second, who followed his master on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
voyage, is in the Court of Chancery at Copenhagen;
the third was beheaded on April 28.</p>

<p>4. There is no supreme council at Altona; that
town, being no capital, hath but a corporation, and no
other council. In that corporation there is no assessor,
great or little.</p>

<p>To this crushing reply Reverdil adds that every circumstance
in the book is absolutely false, and grounded
on facts and a state of things that never existed. For
instance, the conduct of the queen dowager in the
king's council is very circumstantially described; but
she never sat in the king's council.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>There is but little information to be derived about the
life of Caroline Matilda during the year 1773. All we
know is, that she continued to devote her life to charity
and literary pursuits. Being endowed with a rare desire
for learning and a splendid memory, she soon became
versed in the beauties of German literature.
Every evening before supper she had either German
works read to her or read them herself. "The Death
of Abel" moved her to tears, and Gellert was another
of her favourite poets. She knew many of his hymns
by heart, and was fondest of the one beginning "I ne'er
will seek to injure him, who seeks to injure me." She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
arranged a small hand library in a turret room hung
with green damask, where she liked most to sit, and
amused herself in turn with music and reading. Although
she was a first-rate musician, she continued to
take lessons in the art; but only cared for serious and
tragical compositions, and might frequently be heard
confiding to the instrument the grief that agitated her
sorrowing heart.</p>

<p>In order to distract her thoughts, a theatre was arranged
in the palace. On January, 1773, Schröder's
celebrated company of comedians came to Celle, and
gave their first performance on the court stage, a spacious
box having been railed off in the pit for the
queen, the court, and the nobility. The queen attended
nearly every performance, and the court chamberlain
carefully obeyed the instructions he had received from
London, only to allow amusing performances to take
place, so that Holberg's comedies were frequently
played, but never tragedies, or even serious dramas.
That this precaution was necessary, was seen on the
performance of the play "Appearances are Deceptive,"
in which the appearance of some children on the stage
produced so violent an impression on the queen, that
she at once quitted the playhouse, and, in spite of the
rough breeze, was obliged to walk about for a long time
in the gardens ere she could regain her self-possession.
Afterwards, the court at times acted plays, in order to
provide a slight amusement for their beloved queen.</p>

<p>An idea of Caroline Matilda's mode of life will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
best formed, however, from a perusal of the following
letter to her sister, written in the summer of 1773:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>M<span class="smcap">ADAM AND DEAR</span> S<span class="smcap">ISTER</span>,</p>

<p>Thanks to Heaven for having made me sensible of
the futility and delusion of all worldly pomp and stately
nothingness. Believe me when I tell you that I have
not once wished to be again an enthroned queen. Were
my dear children restored to me, I should think, if
there is on this earth perfect happiness, I might enjoy
it in a private station with them; but the Supreme
Disposer of all events has decreed that my peace of
mind should be continually disturbed by what I feel on
this cruel and unnatural separation. You are a tender
mother, and I appeal to your own fondness. Pray
give my love to the dear Augusta<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and all her brothers;
now that she is in her seventh year, she is, I dare say,
an agreeable, chatty companion. As for Charles, he
is, I understand, like his father, born a warrior: nothing
but drums, swords, and horses can please his
martial inclination. George, Augustus, and William
equally contribute to your comfort and amusement.
Tell them I have some little presents I shall send
them the first opportunity.</p>

<p>You desire to know how I vary my occupation and
amusements in this residence. I get up between
seven and eight o'clock; take a walk in the garden if
the weather permits; give my instructions to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
gardener for the day; observe his men at work with
that contented mind which is a perpetual feast; return
to my castle for breakfast; dress myself from ten to
eleven; appear in my little circle at twelve; retire to
my apartment about one; read, and take an airing till
dinner; walk again about an hour in the garden with
the ladies of my retinue; drink tea, play upon the
harpsichord, sometimes a little party at quadrille
before supper; and, am commonly in bed before
twelve. Every Monday, I receive petitions from real
objects of compassion, and delight in relieving their
necessities according to my power; and thus, every
week passes in a regular rotation of rational conversation,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lectures amusantes et instructives</i>, musical entertainments,
walks, and a little curious needlework. I
see everybody happy around me, and vie with each
other in proofs of zeal and affection for my person.
Now, I can truly say, I cultivate friendship and
philosophy, which are strangers to the throne. I
expect to see you soon, according to your promise;
this visit will add greatly to the comfort of your most
affectionate sister,</p>

<p>But all these efforts were impotent to dispel the
expression of gnawing sorrow, which was imprinted
on the countenance of the queen, and was spread over
her whole manner. Toward the middle of 1774, a
great pleasure, however, was caused the queen, by the
receipt of a portrait of her son, the crown prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Frederick, which was sent her from Copenhagen.
Shortly after she had received the picture, her grande
maîtresse, Madame d'Ompteda, entered the room,
because she had heard the queen speaking loudly, and
was much surprised at finding her alone. With tears
in her eyes, but with the sweet smile which, even in
sorrowful moments, played round her mouth, she said
to the grand mistress:</p>

<p>"You cannot account for hearing me speaking
loudly and yet not finding any one with me? Well,
do you know with whom I was conversing? It was
with this dear picture."</p>

<p>And she then produced the portrait of the youthful
prince.</p>

<p>"And now that you have surprised me," the queen
continued, "you shall also know what I was saying
to the picture. I employed the words which you a
few days ago placed in the mouth of a daughter who
had found her lost father again, except that I have
altered them as follows:</p>

<p>On September 18, 1774, Mr. N. W. Wraxall, junior,
arrived at Celle. This gentleman had, at an early age,
obtained a profitable employment in the East Indies,
and had even attained some dignity; he, however,
threw up his post for motives which may be made
known hereafter but do not belong here, and returned
to England. He was very ambitious, and that ambition
had been fostered by the fact that, having in his
youth ransacked the muniments of Bristol, he had
discovered that one of his ancestors was bailiff of that
city in the thirteenth century; but the difficulty was, to
what object would he turn that ambition: he was unknown
and friendless, while, at the same time, the <em>res
angusta domi</em> warned him to be up and stirring. There
was but one way of acquiring fame and popularity: in
those days, authorship was more respected, as being
rarer, than it is among ourselves. Mr. Wraxall, therefore,
determined first to make a tour, and then print
an account of it, and, for this purpose, resolved to
visit a but little known part of Europe, and thus add
novelty to his descriptions. With this purpose he set
out for the North, ran through Denmark, a portion
of Sweden and Russia, and, on his homeward route,
thought there would be no harm in going a little out
of his way to visit the Queen of Denmark: he had
learned something about her sad fate while in Copenhagen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and this had excited a wish to know more,
literary capital being left out of the question.</p>

<p>On September 18, then, Mr. Wraxall waited on
Baron Seckendorf, chamberlain to the queen, who presented
strangers. The "Private Journal" shall tell us
how he fared:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I went, at half-past one, to the castle of Zell.
Monsieur Seckendorf introduced me to the grand
maître of her Highness the Princess of Brunswick. The
princess herself entered in about a quarter of an hour:
she gave me her hand to kiss, and began conversation
with me directly; it was interrupted by the queen's
entrance, to whom I was presented, with the same
ceremony. Her Majesty and the princess kept me in
constant talk before and after dinner; we talked of
Denmark, of Prince Frederick, his intended marriage,
&amp;c. 'He was a child,' said she (the queen), 'unknown
while I was there.' Hirschholm, she said, was
her favourite palace. 'But, tell me,' said the princess,
'about the queen-mother: she's my aunt, but no matter:
say what you will, you may be free&mdash;and for the
king, how is he?' I very frankly expressed my sentiments.
The queen asked me a thousand questions
about the court of Russia, Sweden, my travels, &amp;c.
The queen asked me, also, about her children, the
prince in particular. I told her how they dressed him
now: I assured her I had been taken for a spy in Copenhagen.
Her Majesty related to me Mr. Morris's affair
with Miss Calvert. She was very gay, and seemed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
no way a prey to melancholy. She was very fat, for so
young a woman. She asked me my age. I told her.
'You are, then,' said she, 'exactly as old as I am;
we were born in the same year.' Her features are
pretty, and her teeth very small, even, and white. She
resembles his Majesty (George III.) infinitely in face:
but the princess said, not so strongly as she. I don't
think so, and told her royal highness so. Her Majesty
appealed to one of her maids of honour, who agreed in
opinion with me. The queen was dressed in a Barré
coloured gown, or at least an orange red, so very nearly
resembling it that I could not distinguish the difference.
I asked her how many languages she spoke.
'Five,' she said, 'Danish, English, French, German,
and Italian.' The princess is much thinner in face,
but not a great deal less in her person: she wants the
Queen of Denmark's teeth, but has a very good complexion.
She asked me about the Duchess of Glo'ster,
if I had seen her, if I knew her. 'She is a very fine
woman,' she added, 'even now.' Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; was
mentioned. 'She was a prodigious favourite,' I remarked,
'of the Duke of York.' She replied, with a
smile, 'For a moment.' She did me the honour to ask
me to take Brunswick in my way next summer, or
whenever I visited Germany again. She said she might,
and should, have mistaken me for a Frenchman. 'You
don't take that for a compliment, do you?' the queen
observed. 'Indeed, no! I was too proud of my country.'
Macaronies formed a part of our conversation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
''Tis all over now,' I said, 'the word is quite extinct
in England.' 'But, tell me,' said her Majesty, 'tell
me ingenuously, were you not a bit of a one, while it
lasted?' I assured her not. I took my leave soon
after dinner.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, Sept. 20.&mdash;'Tis a very pleasant, delightful
walk round the ramparts, of a full English mile.
The gardens, likewise, near the town are very pleasant
and well kept. The streets of Zell are for the most
part wide enough, and well paved, but the buildings
are very old and very miserable. The fortifications are
merely nominal, of no sort of strength. The castle
stands detached from the town; it is a square building,
surrounded by a broad, wet ditch. There were
formerly round towers at the corners, but they have
been pulled down. It was built by one of the ancient
dukes of Zell; within it is a quadrangle. About ten
o'clock I went to the Hôtel de Ville, where at this
time the shops of the merchants who come to the fair
of Zell are held. Her Majesty the Queen, and her
sister the princess, were there. I had the honour to
talk with them near an hour; we conversed in English
most familiarly on fifty subjects&mdash;the Grand Duke
of Russia, the empress, the peace between Russia and
Turkey, my travels, Dantzig, formed the chief articles.
I showed her Majesty my medals of the Empress
of Russia and some other things. She was
dressed quite à l'Anglaise: a white bonnet, a pale
pink nightgown, a gauze handkerchief, a little locket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
on her bosom. Her face is very handsome: they are
his Majesty's features, but all softened and harmonized.
Pity she is so large in her person. The princess was
quite English all over: a black hat over her eyes, and
a common nightgown with a black apron."</p>

<p>Little anticipating that he should see the Queen of
Denmark so soon again, Mr. Wraxall proceeded
leisurely through Hanover, which he says may be
truly described as "a hungry electorate," to Verden
and Bremen. On Sept. 27 he reached Hamburg, and
dined with Mr. Hanbury, the English consul, on the
following day. Among the company present were
Baron von Schimmelmann and his lady, Baroness von
Bülow, "a very elegant woman," and M. le Texier,
who had been treasurer to Christian VII. during the
memorable tour. On the next night Mr. Wraxall
was gratified at the Opera with a sight of the celebrated,
or rather notorious, Countess Holstein, of
whom he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I examined her through my glass. She is doubtless
pretty, though not in my opinion so divinely fair
as fame says. Her history at Hirschholm is well
known. There was no gallantry, I thought, marked
in her features, though 'tis said she certainly has that
quality in her constitution. I thought of the unhappy
Brandt as I looked at her."</p>

<p>At this time the city of Altona, only half a mile
from Hamburg, was crowded with the adherents and
partisans of the queen, many of them being of the
first families in Denmark. Hamburg offered more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
amusements than Altona, and they were therefore
constantly to be found in the houses of the opulent
citizens. Baron von Bülow, master of the horse to the
Queen of Denmark, who was arrested at the time of
the palace revolution, and eventually exiled to Altona,
was among the number. They had already conceived
the plan of effecting a counter revolution, and of
restoring Queen Matilda, an enterprise to which they
were urged by many motives.</p>

<p>The new ministry in Denmark was already growing
unpopular from its weakness, languor, and incapacity.
It was understood that the king ardently desired the
return of his consort. The engaging qualities, fortitude,
and talents of that princess, rendered more interesting
by adversity, had awakened the attachment
of the Danes. A numerous and powerful party in
the capital and throughout the nation anxiously desired
her restoration.</p>

<p>It was indispensable, in the first instance, previous
to any attempt on the part of the exiled nobility, to
ascertain with precision the sentiments of the queen
herself. It was important for them to know whether
she was willing to return to Copenhagen to resume
the sovereign authority, which the king was incapable
of exercising, and to co-operate with her friends toward
her re-establishment. But the attempt to open
any communication with the queen was equally dangerous
and difficult. Though Celle was only eighty
English miles distant from Hamburg and Altona,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
still, as the northern bank of the Elbe was in, or close
to the Danish territory, the journey to and from Celle
was extremely perilous. The latter court, as well as
Altona, was full of spies and emissaries, maintained
by the party possessing the authority at Copenhagen.
Such were their suspicions, and so great was their
vigilance, that no person could have passed and re-passed
between those places without being watched.
These impediments had hitherto prevented the queen's
adherents from venturing to send any of their own
body to lay their projects before her Majesty; nor did
they appear to have found any other person to whom
they could confide the execution of so momentous a
commission. They were still under this embarrassment
when chance threw Mr. Wraxall in their way.</p>

<p>Having supped at the house of Mr. Jerome Matthiesen,
where several of the Danish nobility were invited,
Mr. Wraxall was led to talk about Denmark, from
which country he had so recently returned. He expressed,
with the warmth natural to a young man and
an Englishman, his respect for Queen Caroline Matilda,
his concern for her sufferings, and his detestation of
the proceedings of her enemies. These sentiments,
delivered without reserve or disguise, impressed the
persons present that he might be induced to undertake
the commission of repairing to Celle, negotiating
with the queen, and taking an active part in their intended
enterprise for her restoration.</p>

<p>Two or three of the principal persons concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
having met on the following day, agreed to sound Mr.
Wraxall's dispositions, and if they found them such
as they had reason to suppose, they determined to
confide their project to him. Mr. le Texier, brother-in-law
of Mr. Matthiesen, was selected to execute this
task. From the nature of his employment at the Danish
court, this gentleman necessarily had an intimate
knowledge of all the political intrigues as well as the
secret history of the Danish court. At the revolution,
he had been sent to Altona. This gentleman cultivated
Mr. Wraxall's friendship with marked assiduity,
visited him frequently, and turned the conversation on
the affairs of Denmark. In order to gain Mr. Wraxall's
confidence, he unfolded to him the concealed causes
and springs alluded to. He inveighed against the mal-administration
of the Dowager Queen Juliana and her
son Prince Frederick; lamented the misfortunes of
Queen Matilda, and expressed his wishes for her restoration.</p>

<p>On October 3, 1774, Le Texier called again on Mr.
Wraxall, and being together alone, he asked him, after
some rather mysterious and preparatory conversation,
"if he would be ready, and if he were disposed, to
serve the Queen of Denmark?"<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Wraxall immediately answered in the affirmative;
and though he was on the point of returning to
England, assured his visitor that he was ready to devote
his labour, and risk his life, if necessary, in such
a cause. Le Texier expressed his strong satisfaction
at the reply; conjured Mr. Wraxall to be silent on
everything that had passed, and undertook, without
delay, to take measures for introducing Mr. Wraxall
to the persons at whose request he had sounded him.
Mr. le Texier then left his new ally, in order, as he
said, to make his report to his friends, which they were
expecting with anxiety and impatience.</p>

<p>On October 5, Mr. le Texier brought to Mr. Wraxall's
lodgings the eldest son of Baron von Schimmelmann,
and left them together. The baron, after exacting a
solemn promise of secrecy, disclosed, not without marks
of great agitation and apprehension, a project which had
been formed for restoring the Queen of Denmark. He
reminded his hearer that his life, his fortune (one of
the greatest in reversion of any in Denmark), were
entrusted to a stranger, as well as those of all the persons
engaged in the undertaking. They then entered
upon business; and the baron divulged the plans and
the means by which it might be effected. At a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
interview on October 7, Baron von Schimmelmann informed
Mr. Wraxall that, as he was on the point of
setting out for Copenhagen, in order to arrange many
circumstances preparatory to, and indispensable for,
carrying out this plan, the latter would receive his
further instructions from Baron von Bülow.</p>

<p>After several interviews with this nobleman, it was
finally arranged that Mr. Wraxall should set out for
Celle with all practicable despatch. But points of
material consequence must previously be adopted.
Among them, the most important were the agent's
credentials and despatches. It was dangerous to
commit anything to paper, as he might be stopped,
searched, and discovered on the road, which, in more
than one place, ran through the dominions of Denmark.
On the other hand, it was indispensable to
convince the queen that he was invested with powers
to treat with her, on the part of the noblemen exiled
to Altona, as well as other persons in various parts of
the Danish territories. To obviate these difficulties,
the following expedients were determined on:&mdash;</p>

<p>Baron von Bülow delivered to Mr. Wraxall in lieu
of credentials a seal, with which, when in Queen
Matilda's family, he was accustomed to seal those
private or confidential communications that he often,
from the nature of his office, had occasion to make to
her. He assured Mr. Wraxall that, so soon as her
Majesty should see it, she would have no doubt of his
coming from the baron, and would have faith in what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
he was empowered to impart. This seal was to be
produced in the event of Caroline Matilda assenting
to the plan.</p>

<p>The plan was, that a numerous and powerful party
was disposed to restore her to the throne, and that
they had invested Mr. Wraxall, as their agent and
representative, with powers to treat with her. They
were ready and willing to incur all the dangers or
hazard annexed to such an enterprise, provided she,
on her part, agreed to three conditions:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>First.</em> That she assured them of her willingness
to return to Denmark, and to assume the reins of
government, which the king was incapacitated to
direct in person.</p>

<p><em>Secondly.</em> That she engaged to co-operate with, and
to assist her adherents in every way and by every
mode in her power.</p>

<p><em>Thirdly.</em> That she would endeavour to induce the
King of Great Britain, her brother, to extend his protection
and assistance toward the success of the enterprise.</p>

<p>As for obvious reasons it would have been imprudent
and hazardous to commit these propositions to
paper, it was left to Mr. Wraxall to draw up a letter
to the queen as soon as he arrived at Celle. It
was likewise settled that, in order more effectually to
evade suspicion or enquiry, he should, on leaving
Celle, proceed to Hanover, as if on his way to Holland,
and thence return by cross-roads to Hamburg. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
case her Majesty assented to the three propositions
made her, Mr. Wraxall was authorized to name
Baron von Bülow, and young Baron von Schimmelmann,
as the two avowed chiefs of the proposed
counter-revolution. No other names were entrusted
to him, as these two were judged sufficient in this
early stage of the business; eight days were calculated
as adequate for the purposes of the mission, and a
spot was fixed on in the city of Hamburg where Mr.
Wraxall, on his return, should meet Baron von Bülow
at a certain hour.</p>

<p>Thus authorized and instructed, the agent set out
from Hamburg on the evening of October 8, 1774,
travelled all night, and reached Celle on the ensuing
evening. He learned immediately, to his great regret,
that the Hereditary Princess of Brunswick was
then in the castle, on a visit to her sister, the queen.
Her presence augmented the difficulties of his errand,
and the Danish nobility had warned him to be on his
guard with respect to her. They dreaded lest the
queen, from motives of affection and confidence, might
communicate to her the nature or purpose of his
errand. They were equally afraid of her suspecting
or discovering it. These apprehensions were founded
on the circumstance that the queen dowager of Denmark,
Juliana Maria, was sister to the then reigning
Duke of Brunswick, and aunt to the hereditary
prince.</p>

<p>One great and important arrangement yet remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
to be made ere Mr. Wraxall could advance further,&mdash;the
mode of delivering his despatches to the queen.
It was hardly practicable to present a letter to her,
except in public; and even to do that, a pretext was
necessary, which might have, at least, an air of
plausibility. Mr. Wraxall, while at Hamburg, had
accidentally heard Mr. Mathias, the British minister,
say that he might have occasion to write to her
Majesty at Celle on the subject of a company of
comedians, who were accustomed to repair thither
annually in the autumn, to play for the amusement
of the queen. Mr. Wraxall, therefore, determined
to say that he was the bearer of such a letter from
Mr. Mathias, of which he had taken charge on his
way back to England, through Hanover and Holland.
He was well aware that he should have the honour
of an invitation to dine at her Majesty's table, and
as no better mode of communicating his errand to
her offered itself, he resolved to give the letter into
the queen's hand in the drawing-room, when he
should be presented to her before dinner.</p>

<p>Having formed this resolution, Mr. Wraxall sat
down on the night of his arrival in Celle and drew up
a despatch, addressed to her Majesty, in which he
stated every circumstance relating to his mission.
He entered into the requisite detail, only reserving the
names of the noblemen who had sent him, until he
should have the honour of being admitted to a private
interview with the queen. He stated the conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
demanded of her, and concluded by entreating her to
favour him with as quick and explicit an answer as
the nature of the subject would admit. He especially
requested her Majesty to take some occasion of re-delivering
his letter to him, for two reasons: one, that it
might be unsafe for such a document to remain in her
hands; the other, that the contents of it would be the
best testimony to the persons for whom he was acting
that he had accurately conceived and faithfully executed
the purpose for which he was sent.</p>

<p>Conscious, nevertheless, that such a communication,
made to the queen at a moment when she was totally
unprepared for it, before witnesses and in the presence
of the Hereditary Princess of Brunswick, might disconcert
and agitate her, Mr. Wraxall felt the necessity
of guarding against so dangerous an accident as
far as possible. Hence he wrote on the first page of
the letter the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As the contents of the subsequent letter are of a nature
which involve in them your Majesty's dearest interests,
and even your crown and dignity, it is my duty
earnestly to supplicate you, that you will be pleased on
no consideration to peruse them at the present moment;
but to read them when alone. I am likewise bound
to entreat you that, as you regard the safety and welfare
of those who are most devoted to your service,
you will endeavour not to betray any agitation or emotion
in your countenance or manner; and, above all,
that you will observe the strictest precaution to pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>vent
her Royal Highness the Princess of Brunswick
from entertaining any suspicion."</p>

<p>These necessary and preparatory precautions having
been taken, Mr. Wraxall called next morning on
Baron von Seckendorf, the queen's chamberlain. Having
mentioned that he had a letter for her Majesty
from the English minister at Hamburg relative, as he
understood, to the comedians who were accustomed to
visit Celle in that season, the baron waited on the
queen to inform her of the fact. Mr. Wraxall received
an invitation to dine at court in consequence, and went
at two o'clock to the castle. When the queen and
the Princess of Brunswick came together out of their
own apartments into the drawing-room, where the few
persons who composed the court were assembled, her
Majesty, advancing toward Mr. Wraxall, said:</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you here again: I understand that
you have a letter for me from Mr. Mathias?"</p>

<p>Mr. Wraxall presented it, and the queen withdrew
a few steps to a window to read it. At the same moment
the princess addressed Mr. Wraxall, and he contrived
to detain her in conversation while the queen
was employed with the letter. He noticed her Majesty
hastily put it in her pocket, while her face betrayed
the agitation of her mind in the most visible manner.
Fortunately, about that minute dinner was announced,
and the company followed the queen into the eating-room.</p>

<p>At table, Caroline Matilda recovered herself, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
conversed with her usual freedom and gaiety. The
queen and princess were seated in two state chairs,
separated nearly five feet from each other. When the
dessert was brought, the queen, unable any longer to
restrain her curiosity and impatience, took the letter
from her pocket, and, placing it in her lap, perused it
from the beginning to the end. From time to time
she raised her eyes, and took part in the conversation.
The distance at which she was from the Princess of
Brunswick rendered it impossible for the letter to be
overlooked. After taking coffee, the two princesses
withdrew, and Mr. Wraxall returned to the inn where
he lodged.</p>

<p>In about three hours Baron von Seckendorf waited
on him, and informed him that her Majesty had sent
him in the quality of her confidential agent: that she
had perused with great attention the letter, the contents
of which she had communicated to him, and had
chosen him from among the persons composing her
court to conduct the business on her part. He added,
that the queen would, with the utmost readiness, grant
Mr. Wraxall that same night the audience he desired,
if the presence of the princess her sister, who never
quitted her for a moment, did not render it dangerous
and impossible. She fully felt the necessity of caution,
and the suspicions which even Mr. Wraxall's stay at
Celle might occasion. Under these circumstances, she
wished and enjoined Mr. Wraxall to deliver his credentials
to Baron von Seckendorf, and confide to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the names of the noblemen from whom he came, as
well as every other particular not contained in the
letter.</p>

<p>Thus authorized, and after receiving from Baron
von Seckendorf his most solemn promises of fidelity
and secrecy, Mr. Wraxall delivered to him Baron von
Bülow's ring, and acquainted him with everything
necessary to be laid before the queen. On the following
morning the baron returned with the queen's
answer, which Mr. Wraxall at once committed to
paper in his presence. It was to the following
effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>That her Majesty, being under the immediate protection,
and depending on the king her brother, could
not consent to any proposition involving her future
destiny and interests, without obtaining his consent
and approbation. That, if she only consulted her own
tranquillity and happiness, she would never desire to
revisit Copenhagen, where she had been so unworthily
treated. But that the duties of a mother, and a queen,
being superior to every other sentiment, impelled her
not only to forgive these outrages, but to resume her
station in Denmark. That, as far, therefore, as depended
on herself, she agreed to the propositions made
by the Danish nobility, provided it should appear to
her, on further information, that they were sufficiently
powerful to effect the intended counter-revolution.
That she desired to be more fully informed at
Mr. Wraxall's next visit of the names of the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
persons concerned, and the means. Lastly, that she
would write in the most pressing and strenuous manner
to his Britannic Majesty, whenever it should be
judged proper so to do, requesting of him to lend his
aid and assistance toward effecting her restoration.</p>

<p>The queen, at the same time, returned Mr. Wraxall
Baron Bülow's seal, which she had recognised, and
the letter which he had addressed to herself. In conformity
with a request Mr. Wraxall had made, the
queen had subscribed on the first page of the letter
the initials of her name C. M. She likewise inclosed
it in a cover, addressed in her own handwriting to
Baron von Bülow, and sealed with one of her private
seals.</p>

<p>Baron von Seckendorf enjoined Mr. Wraxall from
the queen to return as soon as possible to Celle, where
she hoped to be able to admit him to an audience.
She likewise desired that he would then give, on being
stopped at the gates, a French name, which she suggested,
as by that means, on seeing the report of all
strangers who arrived at Celle, which was brought
to her every morning, she should be apprised of his
return. It was settled that on Mr. Wraxall's next
visit to Celle he should take care to arrive in the night,
go round the city, and lodge at a little obscure inn,
called the "Sandkrug," in one of the suburbs.</p>

<p>Having received this satisfactory answer from her
Majesty, Mr. Wraxall left Celle immediately and proceeded
to Hanover, where he remained two days. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
then crossed a large portion of the Electorate to Harburg,
and reached Hamburg on the evening of October
15, 1774. On the morning of the 17th he repaired to
the place when Baron von Bülow had arranged to meet
him. The latter affected not to notice him, and turning,
Mr. Wraxall followed him through a number of
streets, till they arrived on the ramparts of the city.
There, upon a retired bastion, Mr. Wraxall delivered
the baron the letter, whose seal and address he immediately
recognised as those of the queen, saying,
"Oui, bon, je reconnais bien cette écriture." Mr.
Wraxall then related to him all the circumstances of
his journey, the mode he employed to deliver his letter
to the queen, and the subsequent interview with Baron
von Seckendorf. The baron approved highly of all
that had been done; promised to communicate the
particulars, and the queen's reply to his associates;
and requested Mr. Wraxall to hold himself in readiness
to return to Celle.</p>

<p>During the next six days the couple contrived to
meet several times, though in the meanwhile the baron
made excursions into Holstein, in order to lay before
his friends the state of the business, and to concert the
most judicious means for carrying it on to the desired
completion. On October 23, Mr. Wraxall received
from him his instructions for his second journey to
Celle. They were, as before, only verbal, and the
agent was empowered to commit them to paper when
he should arrive there, observing the same precautions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
in receiving them back. They were to the following
effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That the Danish nobility were grateful for, and
perfectly satisfied with, the answer made by her
Majesty to their proposals, and that they should proceed,
in consequence, to concert measures for executing
at a proper time the intended revolution in her
favour. That Baron von Bülow, in addition to his
own name, and that of young Baron von Schimmelmann,
was empowered to vouch for Count von Laurvig,
his father-in-law, the viceroy of Norway, who was to
secure that kingdom and its capital, Christiania, for
the queen. That old Baron von Schimmelmann,
though he refused to take any active part in the enterprise,
or to risk by any overt act his safety and
fortune, was sincerely attached to the cause. That
the governor of Glückstadt, one of the most important
places and fortresses in Holstein, was disposed to aid
the queen. That Rendsburg, the key of the duchy
of Schleswig, would open its gates, as the party had
secret adherents in the garrison, who would declare
themselves, when it should prove necessary.</p>

<p>"That their friends were numerous and powerful in
the army, the navy, the guards, in the metropolis, and
even about the person of the king himself. But, that
they besought her Majesty to repose on the honour
and assurances given by Baron von Bülow, as representing
the party, and entreated her not to insist on
the disclosure of their names&mdash;a disclosure which could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
be of little or no advantage or gratification to her, and
which might be fatal to them. That they unanimously
and earnestly requested her to write to the King
of England immediately, and confide the letter to their
agent, urging the indispensable necessity of his sending
a minister to the court of Copenhagen, where there
was then only a resident, and authorizing such
minister to declare, at the time when the counter-revolution
was being effected, that the King of Great
Britain was acquainted with it, approved of it, and
would maintain it with all his power.</p>

<p>"That, as considerable expenses must necessarily be
incurred in conducting and executing a project of
such magnitude and importance, they hoped that the
King of Great Britain, if he approved of the attempt
to restore his sister, would be graciously pleased to
assist the persons engaged in her cause with some
immediate pecuniary assistance. They besought the
queen to recommend this object to her brother. That
during the winter they would perform everything for
striking the blow, and would, if the answer from England
were favourable, proceed to execute it as soon in
the ensuing spring as the two Belts should be free
from ice, and the communication open between the
island of Seeland and the mainland of Jütland.</p>

<p>"That they hoped her Majesty would be pleased to
communicate to Baron von Bülow the tenor of her
letter to the King of England, as on his reply, in a
great measure, depended the progress and success of
the enterprise. Baron von Bülow particularly enjoined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Mr. Wraxall to ask the queen whether she
would consent to quit Celle and repair to Altona in
disguise, if such a step should at a future time be
thought expedient or necessary."</p>

<p>Previous to Mr. Wraxall's departure from Hamburg,
he agreed on a meeting with Baron von Bülow,
on October 28, at a posthouse in the wood of Zährendorf,
a solitary hamlet nearly equi-distant from Celle
and Altona. It was settled, that on leaving Celle, Mr.
Wraxall should repair to Zährendorf, <em>en route</em> to
Holland, and that the baron, disguised as a dealer in
goods, should go to the same posthouse, without any
attendant. As two travellers, it would be easy to
meet and to pass some hours together, in so unfrequented
a place, during the night.</p>

<p>This matter adjusted, Mr. Wraxall set out on
October 23rd, but, in order to elude suspicion from
passing the same road so frequently, he took the
Lüneburg road. Between three and four o'clock in the
morning of the 26th he reached the gates of Celle,
and, after making use of the name suggested by the
queen, drove round to the little inn in the suburbs.
Baron von Seckendorf having set out on that very morning
to pay a visit to Hanover, Mr. Wraxall was obliged
to send an express to him, acquainting him with his
arrival, and requesting his immediate return. After
which, Mr. Wraxall remained concealed in the inn the
whole day, and employed himself in drawing up his
despatch to her Majesty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Early on the following morning the baron entered
Mr. Wraxall's room, and informed him, to his no small
satisfaction, that the Princess of Brunswick was not
then in Celle. Mr. Wraxall delivered his letters for
the queen, which the baron went immediately to
the castle to deliver. About four hours after he returned,
and desired Mr. Wraxall to go without the
loss of a moment to the Jardin François, a large garden
without the city belonging to the Elector of Hanover,
where her Majesty would go to meet him. He had
not arrived there more than ten minutes when the
queen drove up in her coach. She sent away the
carriage and all her attendants, except one lady, who
remained the whole time. The interview lasted about
an hour, during the greater part of which they
walked in one of the private vistas of the garden.
Toward the end of it, the queen took Mr. Wraxall
into a pavilion where a dessert of fruit was laid, and
he then withdrew by her Majesty's permission.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The
substance of the conversation was of so important a
nature that I feel bound to quote it <em>in extenso</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having attentively perused the letter which I had
written to her in the name and by order of the Danish
nobility, she was perfectly satisfied with it in every
particular. That the persons named as engaged in
the cause were sufficient to inspire confidence, and
that, relying in a special manner on the attachment,
zeal, and talents of Baron von Bülow, she would dispense
with his divulging the names of any more of
his associates. That in compliance equally with their
desire and with her own wishes, she would, without loss
of time, write to her brother. That, if the time permitted,
she would readily give in a copy of her intended
letter to be shown Baron von Bülow for his satisfaction,
and that of his friends; but that, as my interview
with him in the wood of Zährendorf was to take place
on the following day, and could not be postponed, she
must of necessity delay writing the letter. That she
would, therefore, send it by the royal Hanoverian
courier, who would set out for London in two days,
a conveyance, the expedition and safety of which might
be relied on.</p>

<p>That, by so doing, his Britannic Majesty would not
only be apprised of my intended arrival, but also of
my errand, and, as she hoped, be disposed to give
me a prompt and favourable reply. That Baron von
Bülow might trust to her for writing with energy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
earnestness. That she would press her brother to
send a minister to Copenhagen without delay, and
would, in a peculiar manner, urge the necessity of
advancing to the party engaged in her restoration a
sum of money. That she thought Baron von Bülow
must know her well enough to be convinced that she
was ready to repair to her friends in any disguise that
could be pointed out; but she was persuaded the king
her brother would never permit it. Still, she added,
could I come, or did I come disguised, nobody would
know me, as I am much altered since I was in Denmark.</p>

<p>Her Majesty entered on the state of her own finances,
and lamented to me that the limited nature of her income,
as well as some debts which she had contracted
in Holland, rendered it impossible for her to contribute
herself toward a cause in which she was so deeply interested.
That she had not any jewels, the Danes
having taken from her everything of that kind on her
quitting Denmark. She was pleased to express her
regret at not having it in her power to give me any
testimony of her approbation, but she assured me of
her future protection and recommendation to the King
of Great Britain. "You must," she said, "go very
quietly to work with my brother; if we manage with
address, he will favour the attempt; but it will be
tacitly, not openly."</p>

<p>Her Majesty gave me very minute instructions for
my conduct, in case I should have the honour to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
admitted by the king to an audience in London. She
moreover charged me with some private and confidential
things relative to her sister, the Princess of
Brunswick, which she enjoined me, on no consideration,
to impart to any one, except to the king himself,
and not even to him, unless I should see an opening to
do it with a prospect of good.</p>

<p>On the mode and channel by which I should approach
his Britannic Majesty, she told me she had
reflected seriously, and, after mature deliberation, had
determined on the following course:&mdash;That by the
Hanoverian courier she would write to Lord Suffolk,
then secretary of state for the northern department,
and whose conduct toward her at the time of the revolution
in Denmark, she said, merited her utmost regard.
That she would only say in her letter to him, that "a
gentleman, Mr. Wraxall, would shortly wait on him,
charged, on her part, with a very secret and important
commission. That she requested him to give credit
to everything communicated to him by Mr. Wraxall,
and, above all, to aid and accelerate by every means
in his power the object of that commission."</p>

<p>As, however, it might be, she conceived, more grateful
to the king, her brother, that a negotiation so delicate
and so peculiar should be transacted through a private,
rather than through a public, channel; she likewise
determined to write, by the Hanoverian courier,
to the Baron von Lichtenstein. That nobleman, who
occupied the post of marshal of the court of Hanover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
was, she said, then on a visit to England. He had
the honour to be much distinguished by the king, and
he had given many proofs of his devotion to her interests;
she, therefore, would write to him to the
same effect as to Lord Suffolk, leaving me at liberty,
according to my discretion, to apply to either on my
arrival in London, but preferring, as far as regarded
her own predilection, the medium of Lord Suffolk.
She enjoined me, further, to write to her after I had
met Baron von Bülow, and likewise from England,
only observing, in both cases, the precaution of enclosing
my letters, under cover, to Baron von Seckendorf.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the evening, Mr. Wraxall called on Baron
von Seckendorf, from whom be received a minute of
the proposed letter to the King of England, sent by
the queen, which he would communicate to Baron
von Bülow. At ten o'clock at night, Mr. Wraxall
started for Zährendorf, which place he reached in the
ensuing afternoon. A short time before nightfall, the
baron arrived, dressed as a tradesman, in an open
post-waggon. The couple passed more than eight
hours together. Mr. Wraxall gave the baron the
documents; the latter approved of every measure
taken, and authorized Mr. Wraxall to assure the
queen so by letter, as well as to renew to her, in
the name of the party, every possible protestation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
zeal and adherence. He also begged Mr. Wraxall to
hasten back from England as soon as he could, and to
be assured of the gratitude of those persons in whose
service he was engaged.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>About one in the morning the baron and Mr.
Wraxall parted. Previous to the separation, the latter
received a cypher for the future correspondence,
which it was agreed should be carried on under cover
to Mr. le Texier, as less likely to excite suspicion,
and that all Mr. Wraxall's letters should be addressed
to Mr. Matthiesen, at Hamburg. The baron then returned
to Altona, by the same conveyance which had
brought him, and the next morning Mr. Wraxall
started for England <em>viâ</em> Osnabrück. In the latter city
he had a trifling adventure, which seems extracted
from Casanova's Memoirs. I will give it in his own
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I walked over the town, and returned to dinner
at four. At about six my servant announced a "gentleman,"
who would do himself the honour of speaking
to me. He came in, sat down, and stayed an hour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>He requested me to sup with him and Monsieur le
Comte de Marazzani and his lady. I excused myself
on account of fatigue. He spoke English, French,
Russian, Italian, Latin: he was young, apparently of
my own age. Finding I would not accept his invitation,
he took leave, first telling me he was the Baron
de Stampe, a German nobleman. I was, I must own,
a little surprised at his visit and manner of introducing
himself&mdash;'twas odd!</p>

<p>"<em>Tuesday</em>, <em>November</em> 1.&mdash;I went, at about nine, to
visit the count, countess, and baron. 'Twas a miserable
apartment I was shown into. Madame la Comtesse
was a little woman, very young, pretty in face, and her
complexion fair. I kissed her hand, and must avow
she had a very fine hand. They pressed me to stay
dinner, or at least to remain in Osnabrück till two or
three o'clock, after which time they would, if necessary,
submit to losing me. I saw at once the deception.
She squeezed my hand, and added a thousand
pressing instances to induce me to stay. I pleaded
urgent business. The count insisted on accompanying
me to the inn, and would not be refused. When we
arrived, he walked in, told me in a few words that he
just then was in need of a little money, that his letters
of credit were not arrived, that his servant had stolen
seventy guineas and his lady's gold watch; that, therefore,
he must request me to lend him a few ducats.
I pitied him, and, had my fortunes been sufficient,
would not have hesitated an instant to have <em>given</em> him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
what he asked. But I could not, for I had not even
enough to permit me diminishing my stock, and most
frankly told him so. He reasoned the point, pressed,
requested, but 'twas impossible to comply, so he very
politely took leave, promising to visit me in England.
I might, I am convinced, have received the payment
from Madame la Comtesse&mdash;<em>there</em> was the temptation,
but with such adventurers was too dangerous. They
might have served me a worse trick than Don Raphael
and Lamela did by poor Gil Blas, and I might have
had more reason to remember the Countess Marazzani
than he had Doña Camilla. 'Twas a droll adventure:
doubtless their intention was to have won my money
by cards or love."</p>

<p>On November 13, Mr. Wraxall embarked from
Helvoetsluys, and arrived at Harwich on the following
day. To quote his own words: "This day shall ever
be sacred in my calendar. I had now finished my
tour through the northern kingdoms, and was once
more in my native country, after being absent seven
months and three days, from the 10th of April last.
I returned thanks to the protecting gods who had
carried me, unhurt, through so many barbarous nations
and Polar regions."</p>

<p>As the queen, in her instructions to Mr. Wraxall at
Celle, had left it entirely at his option, on his arrival
in London, to wait either on Lord Suffolk or Baron
von Lichtenstein, though expressing a degree of preference
for the former, he went, on November 15, to
Lord Suffolk's residence in Downing Street. Being
admitted, a private secretary requested Mr. Wraxall
to inform him of the nature of his business: Lord
Suffolk not only being confined to his bed-chamber by
gout, but unable, from the violence of his disorder, to
see any one. Mr. Wraxall informed him, in answer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
that as his business was of a nature which could only
be communicated to Lord Suffolk in person, he would
call again in a day or two, by which time his lordship
might be able to see him.</p>

<p>Conceiving it, however, injudicious to lose a moment
that could be avoided in opening the object of his mission,
Mr. Wraxall went directly to the lodgings of
Baron von Lichtenstein, in Chidleigh Court, Pall Mall.
The baron was at home, and so soon as the agent acquainted
him with his name, he expressed his satisfaction
at Mr. Wraxall's arrival; he produced the queen's
letter announcing the intended visitor, and assured the
latter that it would be as much his wish as he felt
it his duty to comply with the Queen of Denmark's
commands. He added, that so soon as Mr. Wraxall
should have put him in possession of the necessary
facts, he would endeavour to find an occasion for
laying the whole matter before the king.</p>

<p>Mr. Wraxall informed the baron of his having
been at Lord Suffolk's house, but that he had not seen
his lordship on account of his indisposition. The baron
entreated him not to call again on Lord Suffolk till
he should have seen his Majesty, and taken his pleasure
on that point, which he promised to do, as far as
depended on himself, without delay. In a long and
confidential conversation, Mr. Wraxall laid before the
baron the proposals made to the queen by the Danish
nobility, her answer, and the objects intended to be
effected by his present errand to George III. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
baron reiterated his assurances of co-operating toward
their success, and fixed a day for Mr. Wraxall coming
again to him, to know how he had proceeded in the
business.</p>

<p>Three days afterwards, the two gentlemen had a
second interview, when the baron stated that he had
conversed with his Majesty at the queen's house on the
matter; that he had to communicate to Mr. Wraxall,
in the first place, the king's positive injunctions not
to mention the object of his journey and negotiations
to Lord Suffolk, but to consider him (Baron von
Lichtenstein) as the sole medium through which all
matters relative thereto were to pass to the king. His
Majesty had received the queen his sister's letters by
the Hanoverian courier, and would maturely consider
their contents before he should give any answer to
them. To prevent any reflections on the part of the
court of Copenhagen at his having seen and conversed
with an agent of the Danish nobility and the queen,
in case that the present attempt were either discovered
or found unsuccessful, the king judged it fit not
to admit Mr. Wraxall to a personal interview. It
was therefore his pleasure that Mr. Wraxall should
communicate to him on paper, through Baron von
Lichtenstein, every circumstance touching the business;
explaining the causes and reasons which had
induced the exiled nobility at Altona to confide to his
honour so secret and delicate a matter.</p>

<p>His Majesty also desired to know from Mr. Wraxall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the names of the principal persons concerned in the
enterprise, and the precise time, mode, and place, when
and by which they proposed to accomplish the queen's
restoration. Baron von Lichtenstein added, that his
Majesty manifested favourable dispositions, but would
give no opinion till he was enabled to judge of the
means possessed by the queen's adherents to carry
their proposals into effect.</p>

<p>Thus commanded, Mr. Wraxall sat down and drew
up a statement of the whole transaction, going into
every point suggested by the king. In so doing, he
pointed out, to the best of his judgment or information,
the manner in which the queen's adherents had
laid their plan for the counter-revolution. Mr. Wraxall,
however, was compelled to avow his ignorance
of many parts of their future plan, either as having
never been entrusted to him, or as being in their
own nature incapable of arrangement till the time
of their accomplishment approached. Mr. Wraxall
transmitted this paper to the king through Baron
von Lichtenstein.</p>

<p>On October 5, Mr. Wraxall received the king's
answer to the propositions, which the baron communicated
to him. It was verbal, and to the following
effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"His Majesty, relying on the means possessed by
the Danish nobility attached to the queen his sister
to effect her restoration, and having thoroughly considered
their plans, consented to and approved of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
intended attempt in her favour. But the existing
treaties between the two courts of Copenhagen and
St. James's did not allow him to lend any direct assistance
toward its execution. He, therefore, would
not advance any money at present, though he would
not object to guarantee the restitution of the sums
necessarily expended in his sister's restoration, after
the completion of the enterprise. Finally, he should
not be induced by any entreaties of the queen, or by
the applications of the Danish nobility, to affix his
signature to a paper promising aid, or even expressing
his approbation of the attempt itself."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>By Baron von Lichtenstein's advice, Mr. Wraxall
transmitted on the following day this answer of the
king to Baron von Bülow, in cypher: desiring directions
for his future conduct. Mr. Wraxall also communicated
it to the queen and to Baron von Seckendorf.
From the latter, he received an answer on
January 3, 1775, expressing the queen's satisfaction
at the king's consent, though she regretted the qualifications
which accompanied it.</p>

<p>In consequence of Baron von Bülow's absence from
Hamburg, and other impediments, Mr. Wraxall did
not receive his answer till January 20, 1775: it was
very short, and in cypher. The baron conjured Mr.
Wraxall not to lose a moment in returning to Hamburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
with the king's approbation of their conduct,
authenticated in whatever way might be practicable.
He added, that his friends were busied in preparing
everything for the expected blow, and that their anticipations
of success were sanguine.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> This letter
Mr. Wraxall communicated at once to Baron von
Lichtenstein, and its contents were laid before the
king.</p>

<p>On January 23, Baron von Lichtenstein informed
Mr. Wraxall that the king would despatch him, in a
few days, to Celle and Hamburg, adding, that he had
reason to believe his Majesty intended to empower him
(Lichtenstein) to sign certain articles, of which Mr.
Wraxall should be the bearer, and which would, in a
great measure, satisfy the Danish nobility. It was not
till February 2 that Mr. Wraxall received his final
orders and despatches; they were delivered to him by
the baron, and consisted of a letter from the king to
his sister, together with a paper containing four articles.
The baron drew these up in Mr. Wraxall's presence;
after which he affixed his seal and signature to them,
as representing the King of Great Britain. The articles
were to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>First.</em> His Britannic Majesty gives his consent and
approval to the plan concerted by the adherents of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
sister, the Queen of Denmark, for restoring her to the
throne.</p>

<p><em>Secondly.</em> His Britannic Majesty insists that, in
the execution of it, no blood be spilled, nor any measures
of severity exercised toward the present administration
in Denmark, except such as are indispensable to
maintain the counter-revolution.</p>

<p><em>Thirdly.</em> His Britannic Majesty guarantees the repayment
of all the money advanced or expended in the
necessary prosecution of the Queen of Denmark's revolution.</p>

<p><em>Fourthly.</em> His Britannic Majesty will authorize and
empower his Resident at the court of Copenhagen to
declare, in the most public manner, so soon as the revolution
in favour of the queen is accomplished, that
the King of Great Britain approves of it, and will maintain
it against all opposition.</p>

<p>Baron von Lichtenstein, when he had placed in Mr.
Wraxall's hands these articles, which the latter saw him
seal up, and place in a cover without an address, signified
to him his Majesty's pleasure that he should set
out on the following day for Celle. After delivering
his letter to the queen, and the articles, signed in his
name, for her perusal, Mr. Wraxall would receive the
latter back from the queen, and proceed with them to
the Danish nobility at Hamburg.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the afternoon of February 3, 1775,
Mr. Wraxall left London, embarked at Harwich, and
landed at Helvoetsluys on the evening of the 6th.
Passing through Holland by Utrecht and Deventer, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
arrived on Sunday morning, the 12th, at daybreak, at
the bank of the little river Dinckel, which divides the
provinces of Over-Yssel from the circle of Westphalia.
From this point, the "Private Journal" shall speak for
itself, until the traveller arrives at Celle:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>February</em> 12<em>th.</em>&mdash;I arrived at the house near the
bank of the Dinckel as day broke: here I found the
royal courier, who came over in the same packet with
me from England. He had arrived here on Friday
morning, but the waters were so deep that he had not
dared to attempt the passage, with two carts laden
with boxes and coffers. The inn was misery itself:
oxen, pigs, men, and women all together. The courier
assured me, that if he had not provided himself with
provisions very amply, he should have been almost
starved, nothing being procurable from the people.
When I had drunk my chocolate, we walked forward
half a quarter of a mile, to reconnoitre the spot, and
see if it was practicable to pass over. After a long
debate, the landlord of the house offered, for a few
stivers, to mount one of the four horses, and endeavour
to conduct us through it. In consequence of this resolution,
they raised my trunks, by putting straw and
turf under them to move them five feet from the surface
of the ground, to prevent the water from spoiling
my clothes. They would have persuaded me to get
up behind the carriage, as, in case it overturned, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
might then have easily disengaged myself; but, notwithstanding,
I got in: as to my clothes and linen, I
trusted them cheerfully to fortune, and only reserved
the letter with which I was charged, which I carried
in my bosom, resolved that it should not perish, except
with myself. We drove off about noon from the inn.
When we came to the place, the two fore horses plunged
in; the water was as high as their backs, how much
deeper it might be I cannot pretend to say, as they
immediately swam: the carriage floated likewise, and
the horses drew it about twelve or fourteen paces in
this manner, when we touched ground, and all the
danger was over. Had there been a very violent stream
or had not the horses done their part, the chaise must
have inevitably been overturned&mdash;nothing could have
saved it.</p>

<p>* * * * * * Continuing my route from Bentheim,
I got in the evening at about eight o'clock to
Rheine. The roads were terrible, and I trembled
continually for my own and my servant's safety. The
moon, however, was our protection, and under her
auspices and guidance we arrived safe. We passed
through another small river, which was swollen with
the rains to the breadth of three or four hundred
paces. Happily, however, the depth was not above
three or four feet, and we got through without any
accident. The country all round us was deluged
with water, and scarce appeared like land. Rheine
is a small town belonging to the bishopric of Münster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
not fortified, though surrounded with old walls.
The postmaster appeared to be an obliging man, and
the horses being ready, I set out at about ten o'clock
at night. I had not driven more than a mile from the
place when the carriage overturned; my servant's
hand was cut by the glasses, which broke in pieces,
but I escaped unhurt. The horses stood still, without
attempting to drag the chaise, which, had they done,
the consequences to us must have been very fatal, as
some minutes elapsed ere we could get out at the
windows.</p>

<p>I despatched my servant back to the town for
assistance, and the postilion to a neighbouring village
on the same errand, while I remained alone with the
carriage. My servant returned first, after an hour's
absence, with an old man, the postmaster not choosing,
or not being willing, to afford him any more help.
We waited, therefore, for the postilion, who came at
length, to our great joy, with four villagers, by whose
endeavours we raised the carriage up once more, and
returned to Rheine about midnight. I am most fully
of opinion that the postilion did it purposely, and
probably by his master's orders. The postmaster's
behaviour justified this conjecture: he neither blamed
the man, nor promised me any satisfaction; he only
told me I had better forget it, and go to bed in his
house. I did so, for what other course could I take
in a country where I spoke the language very imperfectly,
and in which I was absolutely at their mercy?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
To proceed without glasses at this season of the year,
in the night, was not agreeable; and even if I would,
the postmaster said he could give me no other postilion
till the next morning, and to set out with the
same would have been madness. I was tempted to
severely chastise the driver myself, but the consequences
which might have ensued deterred me. So I
lay down in a miserable apartment, as large as an Egyptian
hall, where the winds whistled in every corner. I
made my servant lie in the same room, and held my
pistols ready, but all was very tranquil during the
night. Why the landlord should wish to overset my
carriage, unless to make me return, and get a couple
of guilders for my lodging, I do not know, but I am
convinced it was a concerted affair.</p>

<p><em>February</em> 13<em>th.</em>&mdash;The morning began most inauspiciously.
It rained very hard, and blew with equal
violence. I thought of the poor courier, who would
be prevented by it from passing the Dinckel. I set
out once more at eight o'clock from Rheine in this
dismal weather and without glasses, not any being
procurable at the place. It was, indeed, a terrifying
view on all sides, and resembled a deluge or inundation.
I recommended myself to God, and comforted
myself by the thought that I undertook the
journey in the service of my royal mistress. That I
was not repeatedly overturned was almost a miracle;
and had I been so in the great pieces of standing
water through which I passed, the consequences might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
have been of the worst sort. I crossed the little
river Aá, which was likewise swollen by the rain to a
considerable size. I got at one o'clock to Ippenburen;
from this place I had only eighteen miles to Osnabrück,
but the road was so horribly bad that all I had
yet seen sunk before it. A peasant who accompanied
us on foot about four miles from Ippenburen supported
the carriage at different places with his hands,
or we must have been overset. The torrents of rain
which had fallen made the highway so soft that the
wheels sank up to the axletrees at every step. There
were great holes made in the middle of the road large
enough to take a man and horse. In other places it
was so rough, I expected each moment that the axletrees,
wheels, or brancards must go to pieces. We
crossed two very dangerous waters by moonlight, in
one of which a single inch more on one side must have
precipitated us into a river, where we should, I
think, have been both inevitably drowned. How we
escaped and got safe to Osnabrück I do not know.
In the bitterness of my heart, tired with such incessantly-repeated
dangers and vexations, I cursed the
errand, and swore that I would never again undertake
a journey through Westphalia in the winter, let the
inducement be what it would; but this was only
momentary, and <em>now</em> I am ready, at my sovereign's
command, to return through all if it should be necessary.
'Twas near ten o'clock at night when I reached
Osnabrück, to my no small comfort. I was fatigued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and sore with the continued shaking of the carriage;
I wanted glasses to my chaise; I wanted repose; so I
determined to stay the night.</p>

<p>The landlord of the inn, after congratulating me on
my safe arrival, implored me not to attempt to pass
the river Weser at Stolzenau, which is the straight
road to Hanover, but rather to go round ten miles by
Minden, where there is a bridge across it. He showed
me a letter he had just received from there, which
said that the Weser was swollen to a prodigious size;
that twenty-two dead bodies had been taken up at the
bridge, floating on the water; that the danger of
passing in a boat was extreme, and the inundation
beyond any ever remembered. This induced me,
though reluctantly, to take his advice as the safest, or
at least the most certain in every point of view.</p>

<p>About one o'clock in the afternoon I left Osnabrück,
and arrived at Boomele, which is fifteen miles distant,
at six. The road was, if possible, yet worse than all
I had hitherto seen or passed, but of a different kind,
in some measure. There were no dangerous waters or
rivers; but such numbers of stones, and of so prodigious
a size, that it appeared astonishing in the
highest degree that the carriage was not totally
demolished by them. I started at eight for Diepenau,
which is twenty English miles, but did not arrive there
till half-past five the next morning. I had here
occasion for all my courage to support me. The postmaster
obliged me to take six horses, and they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
indeed most necessary. The country was all covered
with water like a lake; and I passed through a horse-pond,
where I expected every instant to be overset,
and in which the horses were almost up to their
shoulders. At length we came to two vast hollows,
not less than four-and-twenty feet deep, and in which
a great quantity of water had collected. Here I got
out, as did my servant. The postilions carried us on
their shoulders through it, the carriage followed, but
I never expected to see it come out, at least, without
being broken to pieces. It did get through, notwithstanding,
to my astonishment; yet, at many other
places I dreaded every instant to be overturned at the
hazard of my life. Still, I proceeded, encouraged by
the moon, which shone very brightly, and was indeed
my protectress amid so many and so repeated dangers.
Yet the continued anxiety of mind which prevented
me from closing my eyes, and the violent exercise of
the body in such horrid roads&mdash;if roads they could
with propriety be called&mdash;at length wearied and
fatigued me beyond belief. I wished to be at the end
of my journey. I wished I had never undertaken
it; I almost lost that animating principle, that enthusiasm
and hope, which had borne me up and
made me with joy devote myself to every untoward
accident. In a word, I felt that I could brave death,
but not mental and corporeal agitation unusually
continued. But what could I do? I had passed the
Rubicon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Wednesday, February</em> 15<em>th.</em>&mdash;In this frame of
mind, after waiting from five till three for horses at
Diepenau, I again got into the carriage; where to go,
however, I really knew not. There were only three
roads to choose. If I went to Minden, which was
only ten miles distant, I could indeed get there and
pass the Weser by the bridge; but then they were
unanimously agreed that the road from Minden to
Hanover was not practicable, or to be attempted. I
would have gone north to Nienburg, and have passed
the Weser by <em>that</em> bridge, but it was impossible; the
Weser had inundated the road, overflowed the bridge,
left holes big enough to hold a house in the highway;
and there were at this time more than two hundred
carts belonging to the peasants which could not get
out of the town. The last resource was to go on
straight to Stolzenau, and attempt, at all events, to
cross by boat to Leese on the eastern side. I
embraced this last proposal in consequence of the
courier's advice, and followed his waggons. While I
was meditating on so many vexatious circumstances,
and going slowly along the pavé in the village of
Diepenau, unsuspicious at that moment of any
immediate accident or danger, the postilion turned
the carriage short round a corner and flung it into
a deep ditch. By a good fortune, however, which
never totally abandoned me, the chaise just being in
equilibrium, and a peasant running up came just at
the instant it was tumbling over, and supported it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the greatest difficulty with his hands till more
assistance arrived.</p>

<p>I must own, I thought myself lost, and do assuredly
believe that, if the chaise had fallen over, the violence
must have broken it in pieces, and both myself and
my valet would in all probability have been cut most
miserably, or been possibly killed on the spot. I
jumped out of the carriage the instant I could. I
drew my hanger, and, in the transports of my resentment,
I should most assuredly have made the postilion
remember, as long as he lived, his carelessness; but
the fellow was gone far beyond my reach long even
before I could get out. The villagers helped out the
chaise, and happily no material injury was done it.
This provoking accident filled up the measure of my
vexations. To have my life and limbs every moment
in extreme danger&mdash;to suffer by roads, by villany, by
heedlessness, by water, by a train of obstacles which
increased instead of diminishing&mdash;the river Weser
before me, and yet to be passed&mdash;I lost all patience,
I believe I shed tears of anger and sorrow. "In the
name of Heaven!" I said to myself, "am I destined to
perish in one of these confounded ditches? And is this
message, for which I so eagerly wished, to be the last
I shall ever carry?"</p>

<p>I trembled as I once more entered the carriage,
which I began to think was no other than my coffin.
Another postilion mounted, and I fairly told him that
if he overset me I would put him to death on the spot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
whatever consequences might ensue. I abandoned
myself to fortune; worn and oppressed by such continued
exertions, my senses sank under it, and though
in momentary expectation of being again overturned,
I yet fell asleep for a few minutes. I arrived safe, notwithstanding,
at Stolzenau, and walked down, accompanied
by the courier, to view the Weser. What a
sight! it was more than a mile and a half wide, and
ran with vast rapidity. The meadows, the very hedges
all under water, and extending quite to the village of
Leese on the other side. I was determined, if I died,
to attempt the passage. I agreed instantly with some
boatmen to take me and my carriage over in a boat.
They would not go that night, but agreed to carry me
to-morrow morning at six o'clock. So I shall see some
end to my misadventures. I write this from Stolzenau.
The courier left all his waggons, for it was totally impossible
to get them over in any manner, and went
away with his letters only to Hanover in a small boat.
I wrote to Baron von Seckendorf by him, telling him
where I was, and my resolution, my fixed determination,
at all events, to cross to-morrow, for I preferred
anything to remaining in a vile inn, in a horrid village,
with the Weser in full view. At this moment
my mind has somewhat recovered, and I am calm
and tranquil&mdash;yet some termination I will see to
these cursed disasters. And now for some rest. Sleep
will, I doubt not, be the kindest friend and restorer
to me in nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p><em>February</em> 16.&mdash;Why should I quarrel so with fortune?
why complain, when as yet she smiles upon me?
True, the roads are terrible, and the dangers numerous
beyond belief; but am I not already past the worst,
and hastening to a queen? This reflection ought to be
alone sufficient in every situation.</p>

<p>I got into my carriage, which was placed in a little
boat, at about seven in the morning, and, leaving Stolzenau,
in about an hour and a half I reached the opposite
dry land, and set my foot again on shore. I passed
through meadows and fields, where the tops of the
hedges and the trees began to appear above the surface
of the water for nearly a mile, perhaps more. The
inundation was amazingly extensive, and reminded me
of Deucalion's deluge. It cost me, I think, about a
ducat to cross over from Stolzenau. The water reached
to about a quarter of a mile from Leese, where the
post is situate. I proceeded, as soon as I had drunk
my coffee, for Hanover, and got to Hazelberg, which
is twelve miles from Leese, at about three in the afternoon.
The weather was beautiful, but the road tremendous.
I know not by what continued series of
fortunate chances we were not upset. I continued my
journey, and arrived safe at Hanover at about ten at
night. This part of the Electorate, from the Weser to
Hanover, is the most beautiful I have seen, and finely
cultivated; but of all the roads conceivable, none ever,
I believe, exceeded this in badness. I drove in continual
danger of my life, and, really, several times, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the deep waters through which I passed, prepared myself
for instant death.</p>

<p><em>February</em> 17.&mdash;I left Hanover about noon, and took
the road for Zell. I do not believe the whole distance
is more than twenty-two or three English miles, though
it is called five German ones. I arrived at Engsen,
which is exactly half way, as night set in. The road
was still the same; it was not worse, but one can
hardly say it was better. I waited for the moon to
rise, and then proceeded for Zell. I arrived there at
ten o'clock, but that I ever did arrive is wonderful.
One half of the road from Engsen, which is five miles,
lay almost entirely through water, and in many places
so deep, so wide, and so long, as might have inspired
terror in the boldest heart; but my near approach to
the place of my destination gave me courage, and supported
me through everything. Once, though, we
were just lost in the water. The carriage balanced,
and the balance was in our favour. I thought of William
Rufus crossing into Normandy, and the boatmen.
"Rascals," said he, "did you ever know a king
drowned?" "Was ever," I thought, "young man
drowned in sight of his port?" I drove to the same
inn where I had been concealed before, and gave the
same name to the guard.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the following morning, Mr. Wraxall acquainted
Baron von Seckendorf with his arrival. The latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
received the agent with the warmest marks of joy and
gladness, informed him that her Majesty, who was
apprised of his arrival by the name given at the gates,
expected him with impatience, and that she had already
taken measures to admit him to an audience that same
afternoon. "When you hear the palace clock strike
four," the baron said, "set out from the inn, on foot,
for the castle. Mantel, the queen's valet, will wait to
receive you, and conduct you to her."</p>

<p>Mr. Wraxall delivered to the baron the despatches
for her Majesty, and went at the appointed hour to
the palace. Mantel was waiting, and carried him
round the great court through a number of apartments
to a room, where he was left alone. At one
end of it was a staircase communicating with the
queen's chamber. In a minute afterwards, Caroline
Matilda came in, and her reception of her agent was
most gracious. The account of the interview shall
be told from the "Journal:"&mdash;</p>

<p>"We conversed till about ten minutes past six,
entirely alone, and in the most unreserved, undisguised
manner. Her Majesty made me the recital of
her reign, of the revolution, of her own conduct on
that fatal night when she lost her crown. I listened
in silence and astonishment. What an avowal, what
a recapitulation did she not make me! Her words are
for ever graven on my heart. I could repeat her story
almost verbatim. I know what scarce any other man
on earth <em>can</em> know. I must own, her unreserve, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
goodness, her minute detail of circumstances the most
concealed in their nature, my situation quite alone with
her, superadded to some consciousness still more affecting,
made me more than once forget I was talking to
a queen. She was dressed in a brown silk Polonaise,
trimmed with green silk. Her hair powdered. A
locket on her bosom. Her under-lip is too large, but
her teeth are fine, and that family violence in speaking
becomes her. Her nose is finely shaped, and her eyes are
eloquent. She is thinner in the face than she was last
October. She showed me his Majesty's letters to her,
and permitted me to carry an extract from one away
with me. She was obliged to leave me soon after six,
which, otherwise, she seemed in no way inclined to
do. Her talents are very good, and in mimicry she
excels. Her specimen of Prince Frederick of Denmark
was excellent. She went, and I remained ten
minutes alone. The valet came again and conducted
me to a distant chamber of the palace, where the baron
attended my coming. We conversed together till near
eight, then I returned home. The baron himself conducted
me to a private staircase, by which I descended
into the great court, and thence, under cover of the
night, got home undiscovered. This was <em>one</em> of the
singular days of my life!"</p>

<p>Mr. Wraxall passed nearly the whole of the next
day with Baron von Seckendorf, who returned him
the articles from the queen, enclosed in a cover
addressed by herself to Baron von Bülow, and sealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
with her own cypher. She also transmitted to him
assurances calculated to confirm the zeal of her adherents.
Mr. Wraxall proceeded toward Hamburg
on the same night, though the country between it and
Celle was almost everywhere under water. Crossing
the Elbe, he arrived at Hamburg on the evening of
February 21, 1775, after a hazardous and fatiguing
journey.</p>

<p>On the following day he wrote to Baron von Bülow,
by means of Monsieur le Texier, informing him of his
return. The baron came to Mr. Wraxall on February
23, about noon, and expressed great joy at his
safe arrival. The agent then delivered the papers
containing the articles to the baron, who perused them
many times with the deepest attention. Of the two
first articles he expressed the highest approbation.
He regretted that the King of England would not
advance any pecuniary assistance toward accomplishing
his sister's restoration. But he lamented much more
that the fourth article only stipulated or promised, on
the part of his Britannic Majesty, to avow the revolution
<em>after it should be effected</em>, instead of making that
avowal <em>during the time that it should be actually executing</em>.</p>

<p>"We must, however," the baron exclaimed, "transmit
the articles to our associates at Copenhagen, and
receive their reply. That alone can enable us to form
our determination respecting the line to be pursued."</p>

<p>The baron then asked Mr. Wraxall if he should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
willing to undertake the commission of carrying the
articles to Copenhagen, which he assured him he
would do at an hour's warning. After thanking the
agent for so unequivocal a proof of his attachment to
the cause, and admonishing him to be on his guard,
as they were surrounded by spies, the baron left, promising
to return on the next day.</p>

<p>When they met on the 24th, the baron informed Mr.
Wraxall that, having maturely reflected on the proposition
he had made the latter of going to Copenhagen,
and having consulted two of his friends upon it, they
were unanimously of opinion not to hazard such an
experiment. Mr. Wraxall being known in that capital,
his return to it must, in the present state of affairs,
excite inquiry, and might expose the enterprise itself
to discovery or suspicion. They had, therefore,
already selected for that commission a gentleman
attached to the cause, who would set out immediately.
He would return with all possible despatch, but, as
the passage of the two Belts was always uncertain in
winter, it might probably require two, or even three,
weeks to receive an answer. During this time the
baron requested Mr. Wraxall, in the name of the
party, to remain quietly in Hamburg.</p>

<p>On March 14, Baron von Bülow came to Mr.
Wraxall and informed him that the expected answer
from Copenhagen had arrived. "It is," he said,
"exactly such as I predicted and anticipated. Our
friends had hoped that his Britannic Majesty would
have authorised his Resident to have come forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
<em>at the time that they were effecting</em> the counter-revolution;
and that, as representing the king his sovereign, he
would, in that critical and decisive moment, have been
empowered openly to avow and justify it. This is the
only request they make. They know that they are
powerful enough to <em>accomplish</em> the queen's recall,
but to maintain it may be their difficulty."</p>

<p>After a little further conversation, the baron added:</p>

<p>"At the instant when the queen dowager and her
son, Prince Frederick, are put under confinement in
their own apartments, when the principal ministers
are arrested, and the King of Denmark's order obtained
for Queen Matilda's immediate return to Copenhagen,
all eyes will be turned upon the conduct
of the British Resident. If he shuts the gates of his
hôtel, and remains a silent or a passive spectator of so
great a change, men will naturally conceive that his
court and his master are unacquainted with, if not
adverse to, the enterprise itself. It is even possible
that, encouraged by such inaction on the part of the
English representative, the adherents of the queen
dowager may attempt, while the counter-revolution is
yet scarcely completed, to overturn it, or to excite the
populace of Copenhagen to insurrection. We may be
the victims of the King of England's reserve.</p>

<p>"But if, on the contrary, while Queen Matilda's
friends are achieving the counter-revolution, the English
Resident goes to the palace, avows his master's approbation
of it, and adds, that every attempt to overturn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
it, or to impede his sister's recall, will excite the
resentment of his Britannic Majesty, who will support
it, if necessary, by force: all ranks of men will remain
in profound submission. The party is, therefore, determined
to draw up a letter to the above effect, addressed
to the King of England in their joint names,
and to limit their requests to this single point. That
granted, they are ready, without delay, to proceed to
action."</p>

<p>Before they parted, it was settled that Baron von
Bülow should draw up the letter in question, and that
as soon as matters were arranged Mr. Wraxall should
return once more to Celle, and thence to England.</p>

<p>As George III. had made choice of Baron von
Lichtenstein as the medium through which all immediate
communications to him on the subject of the
queen his sister should pass, it was highly important
to apprise the baron of this intention. Mr. Wraxall
accordingly wrote to him on the same day by the post,
expressing in very few words that, on account of some
circumstances which had arisen, he would probably see
Mr. Wraxall again in London early in the ensuing
month. The writer added, that if, unfortunately, the
baron should have quitted England before his return,
he relied on his leaving accurate directions in writing
how to proceed in the affair. Mr. Wraxall also wrote
to Baron von Seckendorf, apprising him that he might
be expected again in Celle in a few days.</p>

<p>On March 20, Baron von Bülow delivered Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Wraxall the letter for the King of Great Britain. It
was not signed by him or by any of the party, on
account of the danger incurred by such a signature.
But it expressed in very strong terms the united entreaties
of the queen's adherents on the single point
already stated. This letter Mr. Wraxall was empowered
to deliver to the queen on his arrival at Celle,
to request her to peruse it, and afterwards to enclose
it in a letter from herself to her brother, supporting
every argument contained in it by her entreaties.
Mr. Wraxall was, as on the two previous occasions, to
draw up a letter to the queen, and his further instructions
for her were to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To assure her Majesty, on the part of the Danish
nobility engaged in her cause, that they were unremittingly
occupied in concerting measures for her
restoration. That they were so numerous and powerful
a body, possessed of such means, and inspired by
motives so strong, as to render their success almost infallible.
That the consent of the King of Great Britain
to the only request preferred by them would, indeed,
accelerate, as his refusal might retard, the accomplishment
of the projected enterprise, but that nothing
could prevent its ultimate execution. That even a
discovery of the design would not frustrate it; and
that, if the executioner should strike off ten heads or
twenty, a number sufficient would still survive to seat
her on the throne. That the plan, when ripe, would
be carried into execution in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the day fixed, certain of them would repair
to the palace, obtain access to the king, and either induce
or compel him to affix his name to an instrument
ready drawn up for the purpose. The instrument
would simply contain an order to the queen dowager
to retire to her own apartment till his further pleasure
was known; and to Prince Frederick, to remove to
one of the palaces, probably that of Frederiksborg,
about twenty miles from Copenhagen. That at the
same time, by virtue of a similar order, the ministers
would be dismissed or arrested; and a messenger sent
off to invite the queen to return, without an instant's
delay, to Denmark, to resume her proper rank and
authority. That their measures would be so well
concerted and so rapidly executed as to produce the
counter-revolution in the space of one or two hours.</p>

<p>"That they trusted, therefore, she, on her part,
would repair with all possible expedition to Copenhagen.
That a proper escort, becoming her dignity,
should be formed, to accompany her from Altona
through the Danish territories, and that they calculated
she might, with despatch, reach Copenhagen in four
days from the time of her quitting Celle, if no extraordinary
impediment arose in her passing the two
Belts. That her presence in the capital of Denmark
would animate the courage of her adherents, cover
her enemies with consternation, and complete the
counter-revolution. Lastly, that though they could
not yet name the precise time when they hoped to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
proceed to action, which must in a certain degree depend
on the answer of his Britannic Majesty to their
present request, yet, that for many and urgent reasons,
they neither could nor would long defer the
blow."</p>

<p>Having received the above-mentioned letter from
Baron von Bülow, and general directions for his conduct,
Mr. Wraxall again set out from Hamburg on
March 21, 1775, and reached Celle on the following
night, at ten o'clock. He gave the same name to the
sentinel at the gates, and drove to the same obscure
inn, as on former occasions. Next morning he went
to Baron von Seckendorf to inform him of his arrival.
The baron entreated him to remain concealed as much
as possible, and not to stir out by day, as the Princess
of Brunswick was then on a visit to the queen. But,
he added, that her Majesty was determined to see Mr.
Wraxall, at all events, previous to his departure, as
she had various matters to impart to him of a confidential
nature.</p>

<p>On Mr. Wraxall's return to the inn, Mantel, the
queen's valet, came to him. Mr. Wraxall gave him,
in consequence of the order he brought, the letter of
the Danish nobility to George III., and also a letter
from himself, addressed to the queen, containing the
heads of the instructions with which he was charged.
It was afterwards fixed, between Baron von Seckendorf
and Mr. Wraxall, that, on Saturday morning,
March 25, as soon as the hereditary princess had returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to Brunswick, Mr. Wraxall should be brought
to the castle, where the queen would be ready to
receive him. But, after mature deliberation, the baron
thought that it would be safer for him to repair to the
castle during the night before the princess left Celle.
The circumstance of her then being at Celle was
favourable, because no one would be tempted to suppose
that the queen could venture on so hazardous an
experiment when her sister was under the same roof.
It was therefore agreed, that precisely at eight
o'clock on the evening of the 24th, Mr. Wraxall
should wrap himself in his great-coat, and proceed to
the entrance of the drawbridge over the great moat
of the castle, where Mantel should punctually meet
him, and conduct him to the queen. The circumstances
of this last interview are so interesting, that I
shall allow Mr. Wraxall to speak in the first person.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I set off about a quarter of an hour before eight
for the inn. The darkness of the night was accompanied
by a tempest of wind and rain. When I got
to the spot, no valet appeared, and directly afterwards
the guard was relieved. I was therefore compelled
to hide myself as well as I could while the whole
guard passed close to me. The rain was so heavy,
and the darkness such, that fortunately I was not
discovered. I waited in this unpleasant predicament
a full quarter of an hour, anxious and impatient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the greatest degree. At length Mantel came. He
said not a word to me, but, wrapping his cloak all over
me, and covering me with his umbrella, he led me in
silence over the drawbridge, under the arch, into the
square court of the castle.</p>

<p>We went up a private staircase, and he conducted
me along the great gallery or corridor into the queen's
library. Two candles were burning, and the book-cases
were thrown open, as it was uncertain at what
hour the queen could come to me. Mantel left me,
but returned in less than a quarter of an hour with a
note from Baron von Seckendorf, to the following
effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Un mot pour vous, mon très cher, tout va bien.
On espère même que la princesse se retirera à neuf
heures; alors sa Majesté pourra vous parler jusqu'a
onze heures, à son aise. Vouz pouvez lui dire tout
ce que vous avez sur le c&oelig;ur. Le mauvais temps,
m'annonce l'impossibilité de me trouver demain matin
au rendezvous: ainsi, ayez la grace, étant d'ailleurs
destiné d'être mouillé, de passer à huit heures chez
moi. Ordonnez les chevaux à neuf, et partez sous la
garde de Dieu. Bon soir. Je retourne le chiffre
dont j'ai pris copie. Rapportez-moi demain tout ce
que vous avez de papiers ou d'ailleurs. Vous verrez
la reine précisement à neuf heures."</p>

<p>I had scarcely perused the note when I heard the
queen's footstep on the staircase. A moment afterwards
she entered the room. She was charmingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
dressed, though without diamonds; she had on a crimson
satin sack, and her hair dressed. I drew a chair,
and entreated her to allow me to stand and receive
her commands, while she was seated, but she declined
it, and we both stood the whole time. Our interview
lasted about two hours. It was a quarter past eleven
when I asked her Majesty if I should retire, and she
signified her pleasure that I should. She approved of
the letter drawn up by the Danish nobility to the
King of Great Britain, as well as the request contained
in it, which she confessed to be natural and
just, though she doubted his Britannic Majesty's consent
to it.</p>

<p>"I will, however," she added, "write to my brother
the letter requested before I go to bed to-night, enforcing,
as far as I am able, the petition of the nobility.
You shall receive it from Baron Seckendorf to-morrow
morning, and at the same time that of the Danish
nobility shall be returned to you."</p>

<p>Her Majesty ordered me to assure Baron von Bülow
by letter that "she was satisfied with all I had communicated
to her on his part, and that she should be
ready on the shortest notice to mount on horseback in
men's clothes, in order more expeditiously to reach
Copenhagen: there to encounter every difficulty with
her friends."</p>

<p>Her Majesty was gracious enough to express to me
the strongest assurances of her protection. She was
pleased to say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"I lament that I have no means left me of proving
to you at this time my satisfaction. You have run
every hazard in order to serve me. I will, whatever
may be the event of the present attempt, recommend
you to the king, my brother. He can, and will, I
have no doubt, recompense you properly. Meanwhile,
write to me freely and unreservedly from England on
every point, and rely on my recollection of your services."</p>

<p>When the queen was about to withdraw, she opened
the door, but held it a few minutes in her hand, as if
she had something to say: she then retired. I little
thought her death was so near, and that I should
never see her again. In a short time afterwards,
Mantel came to me, and wrapping me up in his cloak
as before, conducted me by a private staircase out of
one of the postern gates of the castle. It was quite
dark, and he therefore showed me the way through
the suburbs to the inn. When I got there, it was
midnight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the following morning, Mr. Wraxall waited on
Baron von Seckendorf. The latter delivered to him
the two letters, one from the Danish nobility, and one
from the queen to George III. They were under
separate covers, but both were sealed and addressed
by herself. Mr. Wraxall received orders from her
Majesty, concerning what he had written on March 14<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
from Hamburg, namely, to deliver the letters on
his arrival in London to Baron von Lichtenstein, if he
was still there, and in case of his having quitted England,
he would follow the instructions which might
be left by him respecting the mode of conveying the
despatches to the king.</p>

<p>Baron von Seckendorf, at the same time, communicated
to Mr. Wraxall, by the queen's command, a
message with which she had charged him. It contained
the most gracious assurances of her favour and
protection, "as due," she was pleased to say, "to his
zeal, exertions, and disinterestedness."</p>

<p>Mr. Wraxall left Celle immediately afterwards, and
took the road to Osnabrück and Holland. From Rotterdam
he wrote to Baron von Bülow, as well as to
Mr. le Texier, informing them of all that had happened
at Celle, and of his being on his way to England.
On April 1, he embarked at Helvoetsluys, and reached
London on the morning of the 5th.</p>

<p>On the next day, Mr. Wraxall called at Baron von
Lichtenstein's lodgings, but, to his great mortification,
learned that the baron had left England ten days previously.
He left behind him, however, the following
letter for the Queen of Denmark's agent:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>J'ai reçu, monsieur, la lettre que vous m'avez fait
l'honneur de m'écrire en date du 14 de Mars. Je
suis très faché que mes occupations, et mon emploi à
Hannovre, ne me permettent pas de m'arréter ici<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
jusqu'au temps de votre retour, pour avoir la satisfaction
d'apprendre le succès de votre voyage, n'en ayant
pas eu, comme vous vous imaginez, des nouvelles par
la personne en question. En attendant, j'ai donné
l'avis de votre arrivée prochaine. Vous trouverez
çi joint l'adresse de la personne à laquelle <em>on</em> veut
que vous remettiez vos lettres, dont vous pourriez
être chargé. Je dois vous dire de n'être pas surpris,
se vous ne recevez point de réponse. <em>On</em> l'adressera
à moi. Des raisons que vous savez, c'est à dire qu'on
ne donnera rien d'écrit de sa main touchant cette
affaire, ne permettent pas d'agir autrement. Si <em>on</em>
ne change pas de sentiment, et si <em>on</em> ne vous fait
pas dire par celui auquel vous donnerez vos lettres,
d'attendre ici, je ne vois pas d'autre expédient que
de retourner dans une quinzaine de jours et de
venir me trouver à Hannovre, où je compte d'être
infailliblement vers la fin du mois d'Avril. J'ai l'honneur
d'être avec la considération la plus distinguée,<br />

<span class="mleft9">Très obéissant serviteur,</span><br />

<p>A Londres, ce 24 Mars, 1775.</p></blockquote>

<p>Adresse de la personne à laquelle Mr. Wr. remettra
ses lettres,</p>

<p><span class="mleft5">M</span><span class="smcap">ONSIEUR DE</span> H<span class="smcap">INÜUBER,</span><br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>In obedience to this order, Mr. Wraxall waited
upon Mr. Hinüber on the next morning. The latter
received him with great politeness, and informed him
that he had the king's directions to take from Mr.
Wraxall, and forward immediately in a sealed-up box
to the queen's house, whatever letters Mr. Wraxall
might give him. Mr. Wraxall, in consequence, delivered
to Monsieur de Hinüber two packets: one
from the Queen of Denmark, and another from the
Danish nobility. To these he added a letter addressed
by himself to his Majesty. In the last, he
thought it his duty to request the king, in the name
of all the adherents of his sister, to admit him to an
audience, as the only person who could, from his perfect
knowledge of the plan and the persons, satisfy
any inquiries, or explain any secret matters relative to
the enterprise itself.</p>

<p>Mr. Wraxall also wrote to the queen, Baron von
Seckendorf, and Baron von Bülow, acquainting them
with his arrival and his Majesty's orders. During a
fortnight, he waited in expectation that the king might
possibly signify to him his commands. But having
received no communication, Mr. Wraxall wrote, on
April 21, to Baron von Bülow and Monsieur le
Texier, informing them how matters stood. He particularly
requested to be told in what manner he
should act: whether they wished him to remain in
London, or return by Hanover and Celle to Hamburg.
By the same post, he addressed a letter to her Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
at Celle, stating fully to her the facts which he had
communicated to the Danish nobility.</p>

<p>It was not till May 10 that Mr. Wraxall received
an answer from the Danish nobility. The letter was
written by Le Texier in his own name and that of
Von Bülow. It was to the effect that the baron's
absence from Altona had occasioned the delay of some
days in replying to Mr. Wraxall's last despatch; but
that, the baron being then returned, they had maturely
considered it together. They greatly regretted
the king's not having admitted their agent to an
audience, as well as his silence on the important
point requested. The state of affairs at Copenhagen
was extremely critical; but till the return of young
Baron von Schimmelmann, whom they expected impatiently
and daily, they were in a degree unacquainted
with the person, condition, or intentions of
their associates. The instant they were enabled to
give Mr. Wraxall any information on the subject, he
should hear again. In the meanwhile, they besought
him, in the joint names of all the party, to remain
quiet where he was, and not to set out from London,
either for Celle or Hamburg, unless by his Majesty's
positive directions.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this letter, Mr. Wraxall waited for
further information, and held himself in readiness, if it
should be thought necessary, to return to Germany, or
to renew his application to George III. through Mr.
de Hinüber, if the Danish nobility should instruct him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to do so; but Providence had decreed that their efforts
should be rendered vain. While the measures concerted
to restore the queen to the throne of Denmark
appeared to be near their accomplishment, she was no
more. The melancholy intelligence did not reach
London till May 19, and it need hardly be said that the
news of so unexpected and lamentable an event produced
a terrible effect on her zealous agent.</p>

<p>On May 25, Mr. Wraxall received a letter from
Baron von Seckendorf, which I shall transcribe here,
as it contains a singular and material fact, that George
III. had given, through Baron von Lichtenstein, an
answer to the request made him by the Danish nobility;
but that, as the king's letter arrived at Hanover when
Caroline Matilda was either dying or dead, the packet
was returned to him unopened:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From Baron von Bülow, Mr. Wraxall received a
letter, in June, announcing to him the same event; it
was dated May 22nd, and I shall extract the first part
of it here, as it proves another very important circumstance,
that the enterprise would have been carried out
whether George III. had given the required promise
or not:&mdash;</p>.

<p>We have seen that in the early part of 1775 the queen
of Denmark appeared the picture of blooming health.
Her <em>entourage</em>, and all who were of the same age with
her, consequently felt the most confident expectations
that they would long enjoy her pleasant and gracious
society. But the news from Altona, the hope of a justification
in the sight of the world, and of a reunion
with her children, and at the same time apprehensions
as to the decisive result of Mr. Wraxall's mission to
her obstinate brother, kept her in a constant state of
excitement, while she was obliged to place a restraint
on the feelings that disturbed her mind, in order not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
arouse any suspicion among her suite, or with her ever-watching
sister. Therefore, it was not surprising that
her constitution, thus rendered susceptible to external
dangers, met a catastrophe half way, which destroyed
all the hopes of her friends about the apparently
blooming princess enjoying a long life.</p>

<p>A dangerous scarlet fever had spread over the
neighbourhood after the severe and tempestuous winter,
and one of the queen's young pages was attacked by
it, and died in a few days. When he was dead, and
laid in his coffin for interment, her Majesty expressed
a great desire to see him. The ladies opposed this
wish, and requested her not to do it. She still persisted
in her resolution, and went down to the apartment
in which he lay. Mantel, the queen's valet,
had purposely locked the door and taken the key,
and when Caroline Matilda asked him for it, he answered
her that it could not be found. After several
vain endeavours, therefore, she went up-stairs again.
Mantel carried in the tea to her Majesty. In a few
minutes the queen suddenly got up, and before any
of her ladies could stop or prevent her, she ran down
to the chamber where the corpse lay. Unfortunately,
the door was then open. She stepped in, and stayed
about a minute&mdash;not more&mdash;looking at it. She expressed
no particular horror or emotion, more than
was natural on looking at such an object.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>This took place on May 2nd, 1775. On the next
morning the queen complained to her bed-chamber woman
that the image of the dead page had appeared to
her all through the night, and filled her with terror.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Still she slightly recovered herself, although a little
girl of four years of age, Sophie von Benningsen,
whom she had adopted when left an orphan, and as
some consolation for the loss of her own daughter,
had also been attacked by the disease, and filled her
with fresh alarm. She went as usual to the Jardin
François, but felt unwell, and evidently had the seeds
of infection within her, for, on the third day after the
visit to the chamber of death, she was unable to ascend
the stairs leading to her apartments without the help
of her lady-in-waiting.</p>

<p>"I must force myself to seem less tired than I really
am," she said to her companion, "so that my good
Omptéda (the grand maîtresse), who did not like my
driving out, may not scold me."</p>

<p>She complained of sore-throat and chill, but sat
down to dinner with her court, though she was unable
to eat anything. When the card-tables were placed in
the evening, the queen felt too indisposed to play.
The ladies proposed her having a sofa, and looking on
at them; but Mantel then presumed to speak, and
advised her Majesty going immediately to bed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
queen consented, and ordered her women to undress
her. The illness, however, made such alarming progress,
that the grande maîtresse on the next morning
called in Dr. von Leyser, the physician in ordinary.</p>

<p>"You have twice," the queen said to the physician,
"extricated me from a dangerous indisposition since
the month of October; but this exceeds your skill: I
know I am not within the help of medicine."</p>

<p>Leyser affected cheerfulness; but at once requested
that Dr. Zimmermann, a very celebrated physician at
Hanover, might be called in.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the queen's condition grew worse
every moment, and she requested to see Magister
Lehzen, the pastor of the city church. The latter at
once arrived, and, in the ante-chamber, was informed
by Dr. Zimmermann of the great danger that menaced
the queen's life. When he was shown into the bed-room,
the queen said to him, in a weak voice:</p>

<p>"You did not imagine me so ill as you find me."</p>

<p>Lehzen assured Caroline Matilda how greatly he lamented
it, and tried to console the exalted sufferer
with the consoling words of faith, read her spiritual
hymns, more especially Gellert's beautiful canticle,
"Ne'er will I seek to injure him;" and concluded with
a prayer on the text of St. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly
above all that we ask or think."</p>

<p>The worthy clergyman returned in the afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
and again in the evening, and found the queen, in
spite of her indescribably violent illness, rather more
calm; and when he returned to the castle on the next
morning, he found that Superintendent General Jacob
had already been with the patient, and the two physicians
were still with her. On the faces of the physicians
he fancied he could read a certain calmness, and,
in fact, the patient was better, as she herself said. It
was the usual lucid interval which takes place before
departure from life, the harbinger of imminent death,
dressed in the garb of mercy for the friends of the
departing.</p>

<p>The queen employed these last moments in the exercise
of a good deed. She requested the clergyman
to write a few words for her to her brother, which
would show that she had not forgotten her attendants,
but recommended them to the King of England. She
tried to dictate the words to him, but her tongue was
already refusing to obey her, and she left it to the
pastor to write what he thought proper. When he had
finished, she took the paper in her hand, but returned
it to him again immediately, that he might read it
to her and seal it before her eyes. The letter was
then handed by the queen to Director von Marenholz,
whom she had ever deeply respected, for transmission
to the king.</p>

<p>Toward evening the condition of the queen had evidently
grown so serious, that her dissolution might be
apprehended at any moment. She was told that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
whole city was alarmed about her, and that even the
Jewish community had offered up prayers for her.</p>

<p>"How this sympathy alleviates my sufferings!" the
queen answered, in a weak voice; and the clergyman
offered up a prayer in words which her eyes confirmed
as her own.</p>

<p>Then she inquired after the condition of Sophie von
Benningsen; and when the physician gave her the
assurance that the child was out of all danger, she
breathed the words, "Then I die soothed," and fell
asleep not to wake again.</p>

<p>Pastor Lehzen, who was present at the queen's
death, describes it in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My office has often enabled me to witness the last
hours of my fellow-mortals, but I never remember so
easy a dissolution, in which death loses all its terrors.
The expression of the Scriptures was literally true in
this case: she fell asleep like a tired wayfarer."</p>

<p>Caroline Matilda died on May 11, 1775, at 10 minutes
past 11 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, at the age of twenty-three years, nine
months, and twenty days.</p>

<p>As was very natural in those days, the queen's sudden
death aroused suspicions of poison. Mr. Wraxall,
however, who asked Mantel about the circumstances,
gives us the following account, which may be regarded
as authentic:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>I desired to know if there was the shadow of reason
to suspect poison or any unnatural means.</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, "God only knows, but I think not.
The inhabitants of Zell are all as firmly persuaded of
her having been poisoned, as if they had seen her
swallow it. They accuse an Italian of it, though the
man had not been near the queen's person for near
or quite a year before. He had been in the service of
the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and being recommended
as an Intendant, was brought here from Vienna. He
was a profligate, unprincipled man. He brought with
him a very pretty young woman whom he called his
daughter, but was in reality his mistress. While he
stayed here, he contracted a number of debts, and
being unable to discharge them, went off with his mistress
to Brunswick and Berlin. He has not been
heard of since. The prejudiced people accuse him of
having been gained by the Danish court, and of having
administered a slow poison to the queen before his
departure, but I am really not inclined to believe this
suspicion."</p></blockquote>

<p>To this statement Mr. Wraxall adds: "Among the
many princes and crowned heads whom the ignorant
and misjudging multitude have supposed to be dispatched
by poison, none seems to have less foundation
for such an apprehension than the Queen of Denmark.
She was exactly a subject for an inflammatory or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
malignant distemper. She had already had repeated
attacks of the same nature, though not so violent as
the last. It was in the beginning of May, and the
weather remarkably hot. The queen was accustomed
to use great exercise, and probably overheated herself.
She was young, large, and of a plethoric habit of body.
When all these circumstances are considered, who can
wonder at the nature of her disorder and death?
Nothing so likely or natural."</p>

<p>Owing to the mortification that at once set in, it
was found absolutely necessary to deposit the body in
the vault of the Dukes of Celle until the King of England
had arranged the funeral ceremonies. This was
done at midnight, on May 13, with great order and
decorum by Grand Maréchal von Lichtenstein. At
the sermons in the church, the whole congregation,
from the highest to the lowest, burst into tears. The
queen's affability and gentleness had gained her the
hearts of even the lowest people, who offered up heart-felt
prayers for their <em>lieben und guten Königinn</em>. Her
Majesty's remains, accompanied by sixteen captains,
were carried in a hearse, drawn by six horses, and
attended by a double guard of soldiers, to the royal
vault. The burial expenses, amounting to £3,000,
though the funeral was quite private, were defrayed,
by order, out of George III.'s privy purse.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>A general mourning was appointed in England, and
on May 24 a committee of the Lords, with staves,
and also a committee of the House of Commons, who
were of the privy council, waited on his Majesty at
St. James's, with their address of condolence on the
Queen of Denmark's death. To which George III.
replied: that "he returned his thanks to that House
for the concern they have expressed for the great loss
which has happened to his family by the death of his
sister, the Queen of Denmark." The king also recommended
the succession of the late queen, for the advantage
of her children, to the care of the Regency of
Hanover, and Baron von Seckendorf was consequently
entrusted with its administration.</p>

<p>The British court sent a formal notification of the
death of Queen Caroline Matilda to Copenhagen. It
arrived on a day when a court ball was appointed, and
the vengeance of old Juliana Maria went so far, that,
careless of decency, she did not even order the ball to
be put off. The usual ceremonial, however, had to be
observed&mdash;for instance, the ordinary court mourning of
four weeks&mdash;as for foreign reigning princes and princesses,
and the children of the deceased were placed in
deep mourning. It is nevertheless certain that this
foolhardy behaviour on the part of the Danish usurpers
proved most offensive at the court of St. James's, and
heightened the aversion George III. felt for the Danes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The unfortunate queen, however, was all the more
regretted in the land of her exile, and in the widest
circles. The two Chambers of the principality of
Lüneburg, immediately after the death of this consoler
of all the poor and suffering in Celle, applied to her
brother with a request that they might be allowed to
erect a monument to the deceased queen, in that Jardin
François of which she had been so fond, so that
there might be at this spot a memorial of the universal
devotion with which the great and noble
qualities of the late Queen of Denmark were revered
among them, and to give remotest posterity an opportunity
of honouring, with silent emotion, the memory
and reputation of the best and most amiable
of queens.</p>

<p>George III. expressed his thanks for this offer, and
we can easily understand how welcome to him was this
public proof of the veneration and love which were
felt for his sister, who had been so cruelly hurled
from her throne.</p>

<p>After receiving the king's assent, the Chambers of
Lüneburg had the monument erected by Professor
Oeser, of Leipzig, and to the present day it is an ornament
of the Jardin François, which travellers gaze on
with sympathy and regret.</p>

<p>The governor of Celle, a prince of Mecklenburg
Strelitz, also had a monument erected in memory of
Caroline Matilda in his English garden, and it is well
known that the Danish poets Baggesen and Oehlenschläger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
have erected permanent memorials to her in
their works.</p>

<p>Some years ago, the following letter was discovered
in the secret archives of Hanover.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> It was probably
written by Caroline Matilda in the first days of her
illness, when she had a presentiment of her death.
When she was first attacked, she had said to her faithful
valet&mdash;"Mantel, I am very ill, and fully believe
I shall die."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>S<span class="smcap">IRE</span>,</p>

<p>In the most solemn hour of my life, I turn to you,
my royal brother, to express my heart's thanks for all
the kindness you have shown me during my whole
life, and especially in my misfortune.</p>

<p>I die willingly, for nothing holds me back&mdash;neither
my youth, nor the pleasures which might await me,
near or remote. How could life possess any charms
for me, who am separated from all those I love&mdash;my
husband, my children, and my relatives? I, who am
myself a queen and of royal blood, have lived the most
wretched life, and stand before the world an example
that neither crown nor sceptre affords any protection
against misfortune!</p>

<p>But I die innocent&mdash;I write this with a trembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
hand, and feeling death imminent&mdash;I am innocent!
Oh, that it might please the Almighty to convince the
world after my death, that I did not deserve any of the
frightful accusations, by which the calumnies of my
enemies stained my character, wounded my heart,
traduced my honour, and trampled on my dignity!</p>

<p>Sire! believe your dying sister, a queen, and even
more, a Christian, who would gaze with terror on the
other world, if her last confession were a falsehood. I
die willingly: for the unhappy bless the tomb.</p>

<p>But more than all else, and even than death, it
pains me that not one of all those whom I loved in life,
is standing by my dying bed, to grant me a last consolation
by a pressure of the hand, or a glance of compassion,
and to close my eyes in death.</p>

<p>Still, I am not alone: God, the sole witness of my
innocence, is looking down on my bed of agony, which
causes me such sufferings. My guardian angel is
hovering over me, and will soon guide me to the spot,
where I shall be able to pray for my friends, and also
for my persecutors.</p>

<p>Farewell, then, my royal brother! May Heaven
bless you, my husband&mdash;my children&mdash;England&mdash;Denmark&mdash;and
the whole world! Permit my corpse
to rest in the grave of my ancestors, and now the last,
unspeakably long farewell from your unfortunate</p>

<p>We have further and valuable testimony to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
unstained memory of Queen Caroline Matilda in the
following extract from Falckenskjold's "Memoirs:"&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In 1780, I had an opportunity at Hanover of forming
the acquaintance of M. Roques, pastor of the
French Protestant Church in Celle. One day, I spoke
to him about Queen Caroline Matilda:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was summoned almost daily by that princess,"
he said to me, "either to read or converse with her,
and most frequently to obtain information relative to
the poor of my parish. I visited her more constantly
during the last days of her life, and I was near her a
little before she drew her last breath. Although very
weak, she retained her presence of mind. After I
had recited the prayers for the dying, she said to me,
in a voice which seemed to become more animated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<em>M. Roques, I am about to appear before</em> G<span class="smcap">OD</span>: <em>I
protest that I am innocent of the crimes imputed against
me, and that I was never faithless to my husband</em>."</p></blockquote>

<p>M. Roques added, that the queen had never spoken
to him, even indirectly, of the accusations brought
against her.</p>

<p>I wrote down on the same day (March 7, 1780)
what M. Roques said to me, as coming from a man
distinguished by his integrity of character.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is everything that can be learned of the death
of Caroline Matilda. Sacrificed in the first bloom of
youth, and decked with the fillets of misery, she was
sent, an inexperienced victim, to become the bride of
a man who was a compound of insanity and brutality.
In less than seven years she experienced all the
honours, but also all the wretchedness, which a royal
throne can offer. Then she died in the flower of life
in exile, the victim of the most scandalous conspiracy.</p>

<p>Several descriptions of Caroline Matilda were written
at the period of her death in England&mdash;among others,
one in the "Annual Register," by my grandfather.
From among them I have selected the one I consider
the best, which first appeared in the "Universal Magazine"
for May, 1775:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The virtues of this unfortunate princess were many
of them concealed with as much art as if they had
been her reproach. She had a ready and quick apprehension,
a lively and strong imagination, with a
large compass of thought. She excelled in an uncommon
turn for conversation, assisted by a natural
vivacity, and very peculiar talents for mirth and
humour. She loved a repartee, was happy in making
one herself, and bearing it from others. And as this
talent was rendered not only inoffensive, but amiable
by the greatest good-nature and cheerfulness of disposition,
she was the life of the company, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
delight of all that had the honour to approach her.
And though it generally requires much care and resolution
to govern any extraordinary degree of life and
spirit, she had no pains of that sort to overcome,
having been blessed with a natural serenity and calmness
of mind that was inexpressible, and is hardly
ever accompanied with such uncommon share of
vivacity; but in her it had so much the ascendant,
that it was invariably the same, and constantly remained
with her through the whole course of her
misfortunes, so that she had reason to express her
thankfulness to God, as she often did, that he had
given her a temper which enabled her to support herself
under the load of injuries she sustained.</p>

<p>Her gentleness of nature showed itself in every
instance, both in public and private, and inclined
her to study all the ways of making herself agreeable,
and of suiting her discourse to the persons with
whom she conversed. But though her general manner
of receiving company in public was very obliging
and gracious, she knew how to distinguish persons of
real merit, and had an effectual way of making those
for whom she had any particular regard fully sensible
of the distinction she made. The same softness of
behaviour, and the same command of herself that
appeared in the drawing-room, went along with her
into her private apartments, and delighted every one
that was about her, down to her meanest attendant.</p>

<p>Her generosity was extended in the most impartial
manner to persons of different sects and parties;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
but her principal regards were paid to such as were
in the greatest distress, to those who were under the
disability of receiving a maintenance from the public,
as well as to the widows and children of clergymen
and officers whose families, by their deaths, were reduced
at once from a state of plenty to a want of the
common necessaries of life.</p>

<p>In these acts of benevolence she avoided all appearance
of show and ostentation so much, that many
persons who subsisted by her bounty were really ignorant
of their benefactor. She conversed in private
with persons of all the different turns of genius in the
whole compass of arts and sciences; and with a few
whom she honoured with a more particular regard,
she entered into all the freedoms of private and familiar
life, and showed that she could let herself down
from her dignity as if she had never possessed it, and
could resume it again as if she had never parted
with it.</p>

<p>It was this affability, however, that enabled her
enemies to ruin her. Perfectly innocent, and even
virtuous in her conduct, her levity and good humour
threw her off her guard, and made her less circumspect
than her situation required. She conformed
with difficulty to the strict ceremonial which was observed
at the court of Copenhagen; a vanity, inseparable
from the youthful part of the female sex, made
her pleased to see the influence of her beauty on all
around her, and she indulged herself in an easy familiarity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
with persons who were more remarkable for
their knowledge and abilities than the greatness of
their rank. Wicked instruments were planted by her
unrelenting enemy the queen dowager, who put a
malignant interpretation on all the harmless liberties
taken by this amiable princess; and, paying no regard
either to truth or humanity in the calumnies which
they suggested, insinuated the most cruel suspicions
into the king's ear, and took the most criminal methods
to destroy her character with the public.</p>

<p>To these infernal machinations the amiable Matilda
fell a sacrifice, in the bloom of youth and beauty,
and the zenith of power. After her retirement to
Zell she was often heard to wish for death, which the
innocence of her life, as well as the misfortunes to
which she had been exposed, rendered a most welcome
guest; and her last moments passed in imploring forgiveness
for her enemies, and recommending her children,
for whose safety she was exceedingly apprehensive,
to the protection of the Almighty.</p>

<p>With Struensee fell all his reforms, and "the good
old times" returned in full force.</p>

<p>The detested cabinet minister had scarce been
thrown into prison ere the new holders of power
hastened to overthrow all the creations of the fallen
man. As if anxious to give the country and all the
persons watching their movements a proof of their
care for the general welfare, they began by establishing
justice on its old basis, and restored the Commission
of Inquiry, who were allowed by the criminal
code to extort confessions from prisoners with the
lash. This care for the due administration of justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
was soon followed to the satisfaction of the pietists
and the orthodox clergy by the reintroduction of
public penance for sexual sins, so that the plebs very
soon enjoyed once more the edifying spectacle of hot-blooded
sinners, male and female, being insulted by
bigoted priests in temples devoted to the adoration of
the Almighty. Still, they did not dare to abolish the
court and city court established by Struensee, because
the recognition of this benefit was universal.
In the same way, a decided error on Struensee's part,
and which, it might be assumed, the reaction would
at once reform&mdash;the lottery, that plague-spot of the
poorer classes&mdash;was allowed to exist, of course, because
it caused a deal of money to flow into the
treasury "of the dearly-beloved king who so dearly
loved his nation," and cash was pressingly needed to
satisfy the claims of the friends of the new government.</p>

<p>The spirit of the usurping party and its adherents
was even more plainly shown by the restoration of
serfdom, so that the holders of estates could treat
their vassals as they pleased. The general dissatisfaction
aroused by this measure among the poor servile
peasants is depicted by Suhm, who once took the
field so zealously against Struensee's "godless rule,"
in an anecdote from Jütland.</p>

<p>"Professor John Egede," so Suhm tells us, "saw a
man in ragged clothes working in a field with some
half-naked children to help him, a few years after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Struensee's fall. 'Will not the extra tax be soon
removed?' he asked the passing professor. The latter
replied that he did not know. 'Oh! yes, I can quite
believe that,' the peasant retorted, 'for you don't
think about things of that sort in Copenhagen. That
was a worthy man who gave us the regulations by
which the <em>corvées</em> were settled. But that was the very
reason, I fancy, why they cut his head off. The new
regulation is only made to torment us poor peasants
till we cannot stand it any longer.'"</p>

<p>It is notorious that serfdom was not abolished until
the regency of the Crown Prince Frederick. Under
his long reign, which lasted from 1784 to 1839,
nearly all Struensee's reforms, to which a more enlightened
age did ample justice, and which had obtained
general recognition through the ideas diffused
by the French Revolution, were recalled to life. The
task was completed, greatly to his credit, by Christian
VIII., the grandson of Juliana Maria.</p>

<p>All that remains for us now to do, is to show by
what means the new faction sought to secure its
position, and how at last Nemesis revenged herself on
the principal conspirators.</p>

<p>The usurpers did not consider themselves fully
secured by having declared the king's sole signature
invalid, but they wished to make themselves safe in
the event of the weak king dying before the prince
royal attained his majority. For this object, they persuaded
the king, after the queen's matter had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
amicably arranged with the English court, to sign a
will, a copy of which was handed to the colleges and
courts, with orders that the document was only
to be opened after the king's death, in case it took
place during the crown prince's minority. As the
presumed event did not occur, however, the contents
of the privy regulation have remained a secret. It
was generally supposed that the king's testament contained
an order that Queen Caroline Matilda should
be excluded from the guardianship of her son, and
that the Hereditary Prince Frederick should be appointed
regent. Other suppositions hinted at still
more important regulations as to the successor, but it
can hardly be believed that the king, however imbecile
he might be, would have signed such a document.</p>

<p>A desire to prevent a possible surprise was certainly
the motive for the decree that for the future
foreign envoys would only be admitted to an audience
with the king in the presence of the council of state;
and yet such a custom had been regarded as high
treason on the part of Struensee.</p>

<p>The union among the conspirators, however, only
lasted a short time after the revolution had been
carried out, and this was specially evident among the
military members. Generals Rantzau-Ascheberg and
Eickstedt stood at the head of two opposite parties.</p>

<p>Rantzau-Ascheberg, Köller-Banner, and Von der
Osten, formed a triumvirate dangerous to their opponents.
As chief aide-de-camp, Köller-Banner re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>ceived
apartments in Frederiksberg Palace, where the
court resided in the summer of 1772. Hence Rantzau
also procured rooms in the palace; but, as the number
of doors and windows annoyed him, he hired lodgings
in the village adjoining the palace, and Von der Osten
removed to the same spot, so that the three friends
were close neighbours. Rantzau also supported in the
Generalty College all the propositions that emanated
from Köller, while he said simultaneously to Eickstedt,
who hated Köller:</p>

<p>"Do not suppose that I have any serious understanding
with Banner. Certainly not. I only pretend
to be his partisan, in order that the Pomeranian
may burn his fingers in the candle."</p>

<p>Von der Osten displayed equal dissimulation in the
council of state, where he supported and praised everything
proposed by Schack Rathlau, while in secret calumniating
him to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>The other conspirators, consequently, began to entertain
doubts about their three ambitious and intriguing
colleagues, and apprehended that they might even
meditate evil designs against the queen dowager and
her son. Suddenly it was announced that Rantzau-Ascheberg,
at his own request, had been relieved of all
his offices, and retired on a pension of 8,000 dollars;
and it was generally believed that Russia and Prussia
had insisted on his removal. There may be some
truth in this, as the Empress Catharine had just ratified
the Holstein exchange, and naturally expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
something in return. In the highest circles, however,
all were glad at being freed from this dangerous man.
Suhm, however, tells us, that the decisive cause of
Rantzau's dismissal was, that he said about a letter
written by the hereditary prince to Guldberg, "Yes,
it can be recognised by the style! But was not
Struensee's head cut off for the same thing?" Immediately
after his retirement from active service, Rantzau
quitted Copenhagen, and went to his Holstein
estates; but, on October 16, the restless traitor proceeded
to Kragsberg, near Odense, in Fühnen, but whether
with reactionary purposes remained an enigma.
In Copenhagen the return of the dangerous man occasioned
such alarm among his former confederates,
that, on November 6, Major von Harboe suddenly
handed him a royal order to quit the island immediately.
Under the major's escort he returned to
Ascheberg, and directly after went, <em>viâ</em> Hamburg,
to Frankfort, where he cashed a draft of 24,000
florins in the assumed name of Juel. He left Frankfort
again as quietly as he had arrived there, and proceeded
to the south of France, where he took up his
temporary abode at Orange, probably in obedience to
royal commands. Afterwards he removed to Avignon,
where he spent the rest of his days, and died there, in
1789, in his seventy-second year, without having once
revisited his country.</p>

<p>So soon as some order had been introduced in the
course of business, Köller-Banner, as representative of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the infantry, produced in the War College projects for
the tactical remodelling of the battalions, which, however,
Eickstedt considered too expensive, and sought
to prevent. Köller-Banner's plans were on the point
of failing, when, in the eleventh hour, the government
altered their mind, and temporarily assented to his
plans. Eickstedt felt so insulted by this, that he forwarded
a letter to the hereditary prince, in which he
requested his discharge, and added, that he desired no
pension. Guldberg naturally undertook to answer this
request of one of the principal conspirators, and did
it in his unctuous way, by recalling to the petitioner's
mind the Glorious 17th of January, and reminding
him of the necessity of all the sharers in it hanging
together. Eickstedt replied to this in his usual coarse
way, that he was sick and tired of constantly listening
to the old chatter of January 17. The object of that
day had been to secure the king's person, maintain the
honour of the royal house, and promote the welfare of
the country. But, if that object could not be attained,
it would have been better had the events of January
17 never taken place. Such dangerous expressions
from a powerful member of the conspiracy induced
the hereditary prince himself to undertake satisfying
the dissatisfied man; and he declared to the petitioner
in writing that the aid of so active and far-sighted
a man could not be dispensed with in the projected
reforms, and hence his resignation could not be accepted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Although Eickstedt had not succeeded in overthrowing
Köller-Banner, another man completely
effected it.</p>

<p>Directly after the revolution, Queen Juliana Maria
invited to Copenhagen Prince Charles of Hesse and
his wife, but the death of one of their children prevented
the princely couple from reaching the capital
until October, at the time when the menacing measures
of Gustavus III., for the conquest of Norway,
had aroused great terror among the incapable members
of the government, and caused the nomination
of Prince Charles as generalissimo in Norway. Immediately
on his arrival the latter was received by the
queen; and, after a conversation about the dangers with
which Norway was menaced, was requested to examine
Köller-Banner's propositions; but, at the same time,
was also warned by the crafty queen against this
dangerous man and Von der Osten. By the prince's
advice, a committee was appointed, under the presidency
of the hereditary prince, to investigate Köller-Banner's
reforms: the other members being Prince Charles, and
Generals von Hauch and von Hobe, while the ministers
also took part in the discussions. This committee
rejected nearly all Banner's propositions, at which the
latter was so offended, that he not only forgot all the
respect due to the king's brother-in-law, but publicly
declared that Frederick II. of Prussia would erect a
statue to him for reforms and ideas like his. When the
authorities also learned that Köller-Banner, wrapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
in his cloak, paid nocturnal visits to the French and
Swedish envoys, his dismissal from his former posts,
and his appointment as governor of the fortress of
Rendsburg, ensued, while the Prince of Brunswick-Bevern
was gazetted as commandant of the capital.
Still the hero of January 17 retained his full pay of
4,400 dollars, in order not to offend him too greatly.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Although the general might now be reckoned among
the exiles, he had not fallen into utter disgrace, for
Juliana Maria afterwards took him under her protection,
and tried to keep him, for the purpose of intimidating
the violent ministerial opposition. For in July, 1774, he
unexpectedly received an invitation from her to come
at once to Fredensborg, where the court was residing
at the time; but when the ministers heard of this,
they were penetrated with fear, and induced the War
College to intimate to the general that he was to
remain at his post in Rendsburg, and send an apology
to the queen. Although Banner found himself compelled
to obey on this occasion, on receiving soon after
another request from the queen to come across, he
informed her that he would accede to her wishes, and
appeared at Fredensborg in the beginning of August.
As, however, he was a thorn in the eye of the
ministers, he soon began quarrelling with them, the
result of which was, that he was commanded by the
Generalty, who would not listen to his plans and complaints,
to return to his post. This induced him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
send in his resignation; but it was not accepted.
Hence he imagined himself indispensable, and took a
step by which he hoped to overthrow his opponents in
the War College. He sent into the privy council a
rambling plan for a thorough reconstruction of the
army; but as Eickstedt had anticipated him, and
handed in a similar project, Banner's was sent back to
him unheeded. Infuriated at this, he again forwarded
his resignation, and dated his request on the eventful
day, January 17th, 1775; but this artful trick did
not avail him.</p>

<p>On January 23rd, a royal cabinet letter was sent to
the Generalty, to the effect that the king, in consideration
of the proofs of fidelity, zeal, and devotedness,
which Lieut.-General von Köller-Banner had furnished,
felt himself induced to assent to his petition of
January 17th in all points. He would, however,
retain his former pay of 4,400 dollars, of which, 2,600
had been granted him for his meritorious services on
January 17th, 1772. Furthermore, he would still
remain in the king's service, and be always ready to
act as a Danish general whenever the king thought
proper, and as befitted a lieutenant-general; at the
same time, he was permitted to visit other armies, and
take part in foreign campaigns.</p>

<p>Köller-Banner, after this, left the country and went
to Vienna and the Austrian army, but returned at the
beginning of 1777 to Copenhagen, where he was again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
most graciously received by the old queen. Soon
afterwards, however, he was mixed up in a scandalous
affair with the magistracy about a child an actress had
given birth to. The excitement caused by this was
so general, that he received his full discharge from
the military service. But the protection which the
hero of January 17th still enjoyed was so great, that
his 4,400 dollars were left him as a life pension.</p>

<p>When Köller went to take leave of his powerful
patroness, Queen Juliana Maria, he requested, as a
last proof of her favour, that she should inform him
who it really was who had calumniated him so greatly
to her and the hereditary prince, and promised, at the
same time, to make no use of the information. The
queen then acknowledged to him that it was Admiral
von Kaas.</p>

<p>"Is it possible!" Köller-Banner exclaimed, in the
utmost surprise. "That is the greatest insult that
could be offered me! The unworthy wretch&mdash;a man
who has dishonoured the Danish flag&mdash;a man whose
wickedness is only comparable with his stupidity&mdash;has
been able to overthrow a faithful and zealous servant
of the royal house by his calumnies! I never could
have believed that my hostile destiny would prepare
such a humiliation for me."</p>

<p>Köller-Banner returned to his native land of Pomerania,
but could not stand it long there, and selected
as his last residence the very city where Struensee's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
memory was honoured. In this city, Altona, the conspirator
died in 1811, utterly forgotten, and avoided
and detested by everybody.</p>

<p>The Pomeranian knight of the Dannebrog, Hans
Henry von Eickstedt, held his ground the longest.
In 1773, this utterly ignorant soldier was entrusted
with the supervision of the education of the crown
prince by a royal letter, which was at the same time a
grand panegyric of the nominee. The king, we read
in it, had appointed him chief governor of his beloved
son, because he could trust to the general's faithful
devotedness, Danish heart, and judicious care. But
this selection was so bad a one, that the excellent son
of Caroline Matilda frequently complained loudly in
his maturer years that he had been purposely kept
from learning anything. It was the design of the
queen and Guldberg to keep the crown prince a
minor as long as possible, and the best means for this
unscrupulous object were certainly to allow the heir
to the throne to grow up in ignorance, to imbue him
with an immoderate preference for everything Danish,
and to divert his inclinations to unimportant state-matters,
such as playing at soldiers. Although the
two leaders of the conspiracy succeeded in this treacherous
design, the country yet had the consolation and
satisfaction that King Frederick VI. inherited the clear
natural intellect of his unfortunate mother, and thus
made up for his deficiency of knowledge, even though
his neglected education entailed other consequences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>In November, 1783, Eickstedt was given the order
of the Elephant; and when, in 1784, the education of
the crown prince was said to be finished, he was appointed
his first chamberlain; but on the very next
day after the crown prince attained the government
as regent, Eickstedt received from his royal pupil his
dismissal as member of the privy council and commandant
of the Horse Guards, with a pension of 5,000
dollars, which was some time after raised to 7,000.
This terrible fall so greatly insulted the arrogant
chamberlain, that he at once left the court and retired
to his estate of Boltinggaard, in the island of Fühnen,
where he died in the year 1801, in seclusion, and forgotten
by the world.</p>

<p>Beringskjold could not endure the loss of his chamberlain's
dignity and his banishment to the island of
Möen, which I have already described, for it was asking
this ambitious man to resign half his life. Hence
he left the island secretly a little while after, and went
to Sweden. What he undertook there remains a mystery;
but it is known that he ordered his wife during
his absence to send in a petition for his pardon, and
compensation for the losses he had sustained by being
deprived of his domain of Nygaard. As no resolution
to this effect was issued, he, in the following year, requested,
through the same intercessor, pardon and permission
to return to his native land. This request
had a better result, for he was not only allowed to
return to Möen, but the chamberlain's key was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
restored him. He received a letter from the king
himself, in which his disobedience was graciously forgiven,
and he was requested to remain quietly in
Möen, or, if he preferred it, somewhere in Jütland,
Fühnen, or the duchies, and there enjoy his guaranteed
pension of 2,000 dollars. At the same time, however,
he was prohibited from travelling again to Sweden, or
carrying on a secret correspondence with that country,
or leaving Denmark at all; and for his own good he
was recommended not to show himself at Copenhagen,
or any place where the court was residing. This indulgence
toward the accomplices of 1772 was further
shown in the fact that, in 1780, Beringskjold's son,
who was a page of the bed-chamber, was appointed a
conferenz-rath, and the other, who was a captain, a
chamberlain. But all this but little satisfied the restless
father. He next asked leave to reside at least in
the same island where the court was; and when this
was granted him, he bought, in a mysterious way, three
considerable estates, situate in the southern part of
Seeland: Rönnebeksholm, Sparresholm, and Sortebrödre,
and selected the first as his residence. When the
court was staying at Fredensborg in the summer, he
went repeatedly to Elsinore, which was only ten miles
from the palace, and thence sent letter after letter,
first to one, then to the other of the persons belonging
to the king's immediate <em>entourage</em>, in order to obtain
further favours; but all these efforts proved unsuccessful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>When Beringskjold saw himself thus passed over,
he formed a plan for overthrowing the government,
and laid his treacherous scheme before a near relative
of the royal family; but one of his own sons, the chamberlain,
betrayed his father's designs.</p>

<p>On June 4, 1781, a royal cabinet order was sent to
Bailiff von Bielcke, Bürgomaster Wulf, and Regimental
Quartermaster Schiött, all of Nestved, to seize Chamberlain
von Beringskjold, on whom a strong suspicion
rested of carrying on a very treasonable correspondence,
and sequestrate his papers. These gentlemen
enticed the chamberlain, by a business pretext, to the
town, read him the king's order, and the bürgomaster
at once conveyed him under escort to Copenhagen,
where he was handed over to the commandant of the
citadel, who locked him up, and informed him that a
dollar a day was allowed for his maintenance. In the
meanwhile, the two other commissioners went to the
prisoner's estate, packed up all the papers they found
there in a trunk, sealed it up, and the quartermaster
immediately started with it for Fredensborg, where the
court was residing at the time. Simultaneously with
the order of arrest, the postmasters of Nestved and
Ringstedt received instructions, during the next eight
days, to stop all letters addressed to Rönnebeksholm,
and send them to the royal cabinet. A similar order
was sent to Bürgomaster thor Straten and the postmaster
of Flensburg, concerning all letters arriving
for, or despatched by, a certain Comptroller Wildgaard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>On June 9, Bailiff von Bielcke and his fellow-commissioners
were instructed to restore to Frau von
Beringskjold all the papers not retained from the trunk
which had been examined at Fredensborg, and to give
her and her sons, in the king's name, the assurance of
his Majesty's lasting favour. Frau von Beringskjold
was allowed to remain on her estate, and was only
advised, in all future affairs, to consult with her son,
Conferenz-rath von Beringskjold.</p>

<p>After a survey of the sequestrated papers had proved
the "continued bad designs of this man"&mdash;such were
the royal words about Beringskjold&mdash;a commission of
inquiry was appointed on November 13, 1781. In
order that this affair which, owing to its nature, demanded
the greatest secrecy, should be discussed with
all due justice, the king selected those men as judges
of whose insight and integrity he and the whole country
were convinced, namely, the Justiciary of the Supreme
Court, Privy Councillor of Conferences von
Rosenörn, the Director and Attorney-General of the
General Chancery, Privy Councillor Carstens, the
Minister of Finances, Privy Councillor von Stemann,
and the Professor of Law, Etats-rath Colbjörnsen.</p>

<p>The commissioners were ordered to assemble, after
giving a solemn pledge of secrecy, and, in accordance
with the royal instructions, form an opinion, from the
papers laid before them, whether Chamberlain von
Beringskjold had not proved himself one of those restless
subjects who ought to spend the rest of their lives
in imprisonment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>The choice of the commission in itself proved what
weight was attached to Beringskjold's detected conspiracy.
It was a peculiar circumstance, too, that
secret instructions were given to the Hamburg post-office,
which led to the tolerably correct supposition,
that the person related to the royal house was no other
than the king's brother-in-law. As early as 1773,
Juliana Maria had felt alarm about Christian VII.'s
sister, and was very glad at that time that the latter
consented to accompany her husband, when appointed
generalissimo of Norway, to that distant country.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> At
the period when the conspiracy was detected, Prince
Charles was a highly esteemed volunteer in the Prussian
army, so that he must naturally have been consulted
by letters which must go <em>viâ</em> Flensburg, after
passing through Schleswig and Louisenlund. The result
of the investigation was, however, carefully kept
private, and it is, up to the present day, one of the
state secrets of the Danish archives.</p>

<p>In the Beringskjold affair, a great number of witnesses
was examined who had been connected with
the prisoner of state, and even persons who had dined
with him were asked what their host had said about
the government at dinner. After the witnesses had
all been examined, the prisoner's turn arrived, and his
crimes, among which a conspiracy against the government
was the chief, were brought before him, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
learned for the first time that his own son had denounced
him. Beringskjold handed in his counter-declaration,
and requested, during the trial, the assistance
of Advocate Colbjörnsen, brother of the commissioner.</p>

<p>Finally, when all the regulations of the law, so far
as the peculiar nature of the affair allowed it, had been
exhausted in the examination, the commission sent
in, on December 31, 1781, their opinion upon the
point laid before them by the king, which was to the
effect, that Chamberlain von Beringskjold was proved
to be a restless man, and dangerous to the general
welfare and public order, and, as such, ought to be
imprisoned for life under a strict guard, according to
the law.</p>

<p>When the king was on the point of confirming the
sentence or opinion of the commissioners, but at the
same time of granting the accused a considerable sum
for his maintenance, the discovery was made that the
prisoner, in spite of his strict arrest, had carried on a
secret correspondence, and undertaken "another attempt
at his old wickedness." After such "mad disobedience
of all royal orders,"&mdash;so says the royal re-script
of February 20, 1782,&mdash;all the proofs against the
prisoner were to be gathered, and laid before the commission
for a final judicial sentence.</p>

<p>On March 3, the sentence of the commissioners was
made known, which decreed the highest criminal
penalty against Chamberlain von Beringskjold, that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
like Struensee and Brandt, loss of honour, life, and
property.</p>

<p>The king resolved on this that Beringskjold, although
he had added more than one offence to his original
crimes, should be spared the extreme penalty, but as
a dangerous criminal remain in secure arrest; be degraded
from his dignity as chamberlain; and be told
that, on the slightest attempt to renew his designs, he
would suffer death. This penalty, however, was in no
way intended to degrade or humiliate his innocent wife
or her sons.</p>

<p>On April 9, the convict was informed of the royal
pardon, and the chamberlain's key taken from him for
the second time. He was left in the citadel under
arrest, but no one was allowed access to him but Dean
Thybring. For all that, early in May he found means
to write a letter to his wife, which really reached its
destination. In this letter he complains of the "incredible
godless treatment he had endured;" dropped
hints about the charges brought against him; and gave
instructions for further correspondence; stating, in
conclusion, that he had already written twice, for
which purpose paper and pens were given him by
special orders of the commandant.</p>

<p>When Frau von Beringskjold received this letter, she
was so affected by its contents, that she was attacked by
a mortal disease. In her dying moments, however,
she handed the letter to Quartermaster Schiött, who
at once forwarded a copy to Eickstedt, and shortly
after, by the general's orders, the original to Guldberg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>Beringskjold was now removed to Munkholm,
where he took the place of Falckenskjold, who had
been overthrown by his machinations, and was kept in
the strictest arrest in the rock fortress. When, two
years later, the government passed into other hands,
Beringskjold fancied that the hour of his deliverance
had arrived. He therefore hastened to send a petition
to Copenhagen, in which he requested a revision of his
trial, but naturally gained no hearing from the son of
Caroline Matilda. However, the gentle young prince
allowed the originator of the conspiracy of 1772 to
walk about the fortress and pay visits, and his sons
were ordered to give him a portion of what they had
inherited from their mother.</p>

<p>A few years later, Beringskjold obtained his removal
to the fortress of Bergenhuus, where he remained as a
prisoner till 1795, but lived in incessant contention
with the commandant, Major-General de Mothe, and
the officers. In the last-named year he obtained the
regent's permission to end his days in the unfortified
town of Stavanger, in Southern Norway, where he was
placed under the supervision of the bailiff. He lived
here eight years, and died in 1803, at the great age of
upwards of eighty years.</p>

<p>Count von der Osten, who became minister of foreign
affairs through the palace revolution of 1772, did not
occupy his post long, but was banished to Jütland in
1774, when, on the recommendation of Landgrave
Charles, Count Bernstorff's nephew, the afterwards so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
celebrated Peter Andreas Bernstorff, was summoned
to Denmark, and the foreign affairs were entrusted to
him. A few years after, however, Von der Osten was
recalled from his bailiff's post in Aalborg, and appointed
president of the Supreme Court; a little later,
chief president of Copenhagen; and, shortly before the
downfall of the usurping government, was decorated
with the order of the Elephant. This participator in
the conspiracy also attained an age of upwards of eighty
years, and died in 1797.</p>

<p>All that is left now is to describe the fate of the
fifth principal conspirator and actual manager of the
palace revolution, Cabinet Secretary Guldberg, after
whom the misgovernment, from January 17, 1772, to
April 14, 1784, has been called the Guldberg Ministry.</p>

<p>Always keeping behind the scenes so long as he had
any one to fear who might contend with him for the
supreme power, Guldberg accepted no seat in the
privy council established immediately after Struensee's
fall, but temporarily contented himself with his
position as cabinet secretary to the hereditary prince
and intimate adviser of the queen dowager, though
he at the same time decided everything. But when
the younger Bernstorff undertook the foreign ministry
in 1774, and Guldberg was alarmed at the influence
of this respected man, he effected his own appointment
to the hitherto vacant post of privy cabinet secretary
to the king, which ensued on the birthday of the hereditary
prince. In this way, the cabinet government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
which had been charged as the highest crime against
Struensee, was re-established, and Guldberg granted
official interference in all higher affairs of state. External
dignities speedily followed; for the king, in
1777, raised him to the Danish nobility, with precedence
from January 29, 1773, the king's birthday,
and granted him the name of Höegh-Guldberg. In
his new post of honour, he very soon made Bernstorff
tired of his ministerial functions;<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> so that the
latter sent in his resignation in 1780, and it was accepted.
Immediately after, Höegh-Guldberg was appointed
a privy councillor, and it was at the same time
published that the king had also selected him as a
member of the privy council of state.</p>

<p>After three years' working in the dark, the cabinet
secretary, who occupied Struensee's post, had thus acquired
the governmental authority. The revolution
was ostensibly undertaken with the object of bringing
the sovereign power again into the hands of the king
alone; but as the mental condition of Christian VII.
did not permit this, Queen Juliana Maria assumed
Struensee's part, though only indirectly, and through
the medium of her other self, Guldberg, as her sex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
did not permit her to preside in person over the
council of state. For the hereditary prince, who held
this presidency, was regarded in public as a mere
puppet, and, according to the testimony of an eye-witness,
valet Franz Goos, passed most of the sessions in
sleeping. Höegh-Guldberg, however, did not carry on
so aristocratic a rule as Struensee, but cleverly left
the current affairs of the administration to the several
colleges. But the higher affairs of state were entrusted
entirely to his guidance.</p>

<p>Advancing gently, he contrived, by his defence of
the principle of nationality, to acquire some degree of
respect among his countrymen, and in this way concealed
his utter want of statesman-like talent. In this
respect the introduction of what is called the Indigenate
law of January 15, 1776, remains a lasting merit
of his, for he was the concipient and proposer of this
law, even though he asked the advice of the two
learned brothers Colbjörnsen. By virtue of this law
only natives could henceforth hold office, though the
king could naturalise deserving foreigners. The motive
for the law was so attractive as to gain its concipient
great praise. Justice demanded, the introduction
said, that natives should eat the bread of the
country. The experience of all ages had proved that
in countries where the education of youth was attended
to, there was never any lack of useful people, if the
regent sought them. In this respect, the history of
the country might be referred to with pleasure, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
could display men of all classes who had served the
country, maintained and saved its honour, and, with
noble courage, sacrificed themselves for their kings.</p>

<p>The consequences of this regulation led to a perfect
Danish administration in both kingdoms, so that every
failing Struensee had committed in this respect was
removed. If this was just, however, it did not compensate
for the errors which constantly brought the
state nearer to ruin in other points, as all Struensee's
beneficial arrangements were revoked through sheer
hatred of him, in so far as too evident proofs of their
value did not prevent the reactionary party from doing
so. The final sanction of the exchange of territory,
by which the former Russian share of Holstein was
acquired by Denmark, was not Guldberg, but Bernstorff's
merit. On the other hand, the former deserves
praise for having effected the liberation of
Falckenskjold.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the crown prince grew up; but
his education was so neglected under the coarse hands
of Eickstedt and by the over-learned Sporon, that, in
truth, he only acquired a decided preference for the
Danish language, but never even learned to write it
correctly. Although the kings of Denmark are declared
to be capable of governing at the commencement
of their fourteenth year, the confirmation of the
crown prince was deferred till his seventeenth year,
and was only then performed in the palace chapel on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
April 4, 1784,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> because it could not be delayed any
longer. To this was joined the entrance of the crown
prince into the council of state, but the precaution was
taken of appointing, on April 6, Minister of Finance
von Stemann and Secretary of State Höegh-Guldberg,
state ministers and members of the privy council, so
that these faithful adherents of the queen might check
any possible influence of the young crown prince. But
the reckoning had been made without the host.</p>

<p>The crown prince, who was endowed with sound
sense and a strong will, had already formed his resolution.
As early as autumn, 1781, he had suffered an
insult from Guldberg, which he never forgot. He had
expressed himself in terms of dissatisfaction about the
cabinet orders re-introduced by Guldberg, which had
been regarded as a crime in Struensee. Guldberg
observed to him, in reply, that the cabinet orders
were the sole sign of the sovereignty, as without
them there would soon be as many kings as there
were colleges in the land, and then told him, through
the tutor Sporon, that, were it not for the cabinet decrees,
he, the prince, would himself be not worth more
than the cat of Slangerup. The brutal Eickstedt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
even forced the prince to make Guldberg an apology
in writing. From this moment, the crown prince
formed the fixed resolution to render himself independent,
ere long, both of Guldberg and the other
holders of the power.</p>

<p>After carrying on a secret correspondence with
Bernstorff, who had retired to his estate of Borstel,
near Hamburg, and receiving his ready assurance
that he would resume his ministerial functions in
the event of a change of government, the knowledge
of the queen's ambitious plans induced the prince to
confide in other trustworthy opponents of the Guldberg
ministry, especially Privy Councillors Schack
Rathlau and Stampe, General Huth, and Count Reventlow,
and arrange with them the execution of his
plan.</p>

<p>Thus arrived April 14, 1784, on which day the
crown prince was to enter the council of state.
When the members assembled, and the king had
taken his presidential seat,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> the two excellencies,
Höegh-Guldberg and Von Stemann, appointed ministers
of state on April 7, and Count Rosencrone, who
had been granted a vote in the privy council, advanced,
in order to hand to the king the formulary of
the oath, signed by themselves; but the crown prince
prevented them, and calmly requested them to desist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
until his Majesty had most graciously permitted him
to make a proposition. As all remained silent in expectation,
the crown prince produced a paper, and
read from it that he gratefully recognised the favour
shown him by the king, in his appointment as member
of the privy council, but requested his father to dissolve
the cabinet, by which the intention expressed in
the declaration of February 13, 1772, would be fulfilled.
He also begged that two hitherto pensioned
men&mdash;Privy Councilors von Rosenkrantz and Von
Bernstorff&mdash;might be recalled to the council of state;
and, further, Lieutenant-General von Huth and Privy
Councillor Stampe be appointed councillors of state.</p>

<p>After reading this proposal, the crown prince laid
the paper for signature before the king, who at once
seized a pen, in order to fulfil his son's wish; but the
hereditary prince tried to prevent him, by saying that
the king must not be allowed to act with precipitation.
Christian did not allow himself to be checked by this
objection, and tried to complete his signature; but
ere he could manage it, the pen fell from his fingers.
The crown prince handed it to him again directly, and
the king not merely completed his signature, but
added his sanction, on his son saying, "Will not my
gracious father show me the affection of writing
'approved,' here?" When this was done, the hereditary
prince attempted to seize the paper; but the
crown prince was too quick for him, and put it in his
pocket. Startled by this scene, the king hurried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
his apartment, whither the hereditary prince followed
him with equal speed and shot the bolt, so that the
crown prince could not gain access to his father.
Embittered by this, the heir to the throne turned to
the four privy councillors, Moltke, Höegh-Guldberg,
Stemann, and Rosencrone, with the declaration that
the king no longer required their services, and at the
same time announced the dismissal of the Supreme
Marshal von Schack, Conferenz-rath Jacobi, and Cabinet
Secretary Sporon; and added, that the first of them
must not show himself before the king again.</p>

<p>After this, the crown prince retired in order to reach
his father by another route, but found that also barred
against him. He was about to have the door opened
by force, when his companion, Marshal von Bülow,
contrived to appease him, and immediately after the
door opened, and the hereditary prince appeared,
leading the king by the hand, and trying, as it seemed
against his wish, to conduct him to the queen. The
crown prince leaped forward, seized the king's other
hand, and most earnestly begged him to return to his
apartment, and feel convinced that nothing should be
done without his gracious sanction, and only that be
effected which would prove to the advantage of the
subjects and the country. As the weak king was
more inclined to respond to his son's wishes than go
with the hereditary prince, the latter so greatly lost
his self-command as to seize hold of the crown prince's
collar and try to tear him away from the king by force.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
But the son held his father so tightly with the left
hand, and used his right so energetically against the
hereditary prince, that the uncle was soon obliged to
yield, especially when the crown prince laid his hand
on his sword for the purpose of driving him back.
The crown prince's page of the bed-chamber, Von
Mösting, afterwards so well known as minister of
finances, ran up, however, and ere the hereditary
prince knew what was being done to him, he found
himself at the other end of the corridor. The terrified
king took advantage of this moment to fly to his apartment,
and thus the victory of the palace revolution of
April 14, 1784, was decided. For, if the hereditary
prince had succeeded in carrying the king to his
step-mother, the recently approved ordinance would
certainly have been revoked, and the humiliating
announcement which the queen had made to the crown
prince just before he entered the privy council, that
henceforth Guldberg would report to him the king's
orders, would have become a truth.</p>

<p>We can imagine into what a fury Juliana Maria
was thrown when her beloved son told her of what
had occurred in the council of state, and the treatment
he had undergone. She raved, wished to go to
the king even if it cost her life, called Count Reventlow,
who threw himself at her feet and implored her
to be calm, a traitor, and said to the crown prince
that he was a treacherous gentleman, who always had
honey in his lips but poison in his heart, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
it was his intention to kill his father. The hereditary
prince, however, had so thoroughly lost all courage
for further resistance, that he wished himself dead.
If we take into consideration the energy of the intriguing
lady, and the nimbus of sovereignty which
had surrounded her for twelve years, we must applaud
the precaution that the artillery under General
Huth, and the palace guard, were held in readiness,
in case any further resistance should be offered
to the downfall of the late government, or the refusal
of the king to sign the order, had rendered the proclamation
of the crown prince as regent, which had
been fully decided on, necessary. Still, all ended
with the fury and passion of the deposed Juliana
Maria, and she had rendered herself so odious to the
nation, that the change of government was greeted
with universal joy, and the crown prince everywhere
received with applause. But the fury of the angry lady
also became appeased when the crown prince threatened
serious measures and arrest.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the king's commands had been
sent to the colleges and courts, and Bernstorff invited
by the crown prince to return immediately.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
Early in May, the future foreign minister and president
of the German Chancery arrived in Copenhagen.
His practised diplomatic pen communicated to foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
courts the overthrow of the Guldberg ministry, and of
the rule of Juliana Maria, with the postscript that the
government firm would still remain that of Christian
VII., but the government of the crown prince as regent
had commenced on April 14, 1784.</p>

<p>Höegh-Guldberg was called on to pacify the old
queen, and the regent considered the deposed secretary
of state's merit in effecting this so great, that he
contented himself with sending this concoctor of the
conspiracy against his mother, into the usual banishment
in Jütland, as bailiff of Aarhuus. The sudden
removal from dignities held so long, and from the
sovereign authority, demanded resignation. The God-fearing
Höegh-Guldberg displayed it, at least externally,
and retained his post up to the year 1802, when
he was dismissed, and retired to the fine estate of
Hald, near Viborg, which he had purchased, and
where he died in 1806. He did not venture to present
an order on the Treasury for 100,000 dollars
given him as a reward by the queen dowager, possibly
because, as a judge of Struensee, he felt his conscience
prick him too strongly; and when, after his death, his
sons had the courage to bring forward this claim on
the government, the crown prince laughingly referred
their impudent demands to the Greek Calends.</p>

<p>The enlightened statesman, Bernstorff, who afterwards
acquired world-renown by his decree of neutrality,
was, from this time forth up to his death in
1797, the adviser of the young, inexperienced, and, unfortunately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
poorly-educated crown prince. As such,
he opposed all odious measures in a reactionary sense,
and it was to this mild conduct that the queen dowager
and Prince Frederick owed their security as
members of the royal house, though they were entirely
excluded from all participation in affairs of
state. When the fire of 1794 completely destroyed
the splendid Christiansborg Palace, these two royal conspirators
against Struensee and Caroline Matilda were
left without a roof in the capital, and were obliged
to seek shelter with private persons until their future
abode was prepared for them in the Amalienborg
Palace. Here, mother and son lived quietly till their
death: the former, engaged with penances, for which
her crimes against her own daughter-in-law and an
innocent minister were sufficient reason; the latter,
more honourably, in promoting the arts and sciences,
for which the appanage of 12,000 dollars, granted him
on the exchange of territory for resigning the coadjutorship
of the principality of Lübeck, afforded him
the means. By his consort, a princess of Mecklenburg,
he had two sons and two daughters; of the
latter, the youngest, the grandmother of A<span class="smcap">LEXANDRA</span>,
P<span class="smcap">RINCESS OF</span> W<span class="smcap">ALES</span>, is, in spite of her great age, still
remarkable for her beauty and grace.</p>

<p>I shall now endeavour to give my dearest father some idea of my
present views and plans. I have, after much time, labour, and
trouble, deciphered the letter pretty well. The Danish nobility
wish impatiently my return, and implore me not to delay it a day
which I can prevent. They wait in eager expectation of my arrival,
with his Majesty's compliance and support, to strike the blow, or
lose all in the attempt. I went with this letter to the Baron de
Lichtenstein. He received himself a letter yesterday from the
queen, which orders him to give me another £100 from her own
moneys here, and superadded to these two sources, his Majesty has
promised to give an order on his Hanoverian Treasury, in case of
necessity, to supply me still further. So you see <em>they</em> are all now
in earnest. I went to the merchant to-day, on whom my bill (received
from the Danish nobility yesterday) was drawn, and he gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
me instantly a bank note for £100 sterling, which I now have in
my pocket book. How much longer I shall stay in this kingdom I
cannot say, nor can the Baron de L&mdash;&mdash; say with any more certainty
than myself. It absolutely and fully depends on his Majesty's
orders and pleasure. The baron will see him next Tuesday morning
(it is impossible sooner, two councils being held Sunday and
Monday at the queen's palace on American affairs), and communicate
to him my letter received from the Danish nobility. I shall write a
number of queries likewise for <em>Him</em> on Monday, though I should
not be surprised if <em>He</em> sees me before my departure. The baron
thinks that I shall not be sent away before the 6th or 7th of next
month, when his Majesty will have had time to give his full, clear,
and mature reply, and some letters are expected from Copenhagen,
which will give a little light how to act. I shall be glad if I am
delayed yet some 2 or 3 weeks, as the spring opens, and winter will
begin to retire every day. 'Tis terrible to cross Westphalia and
Hanover at this season of the year; but that is nothing.</p>

<p>I presume you will now begin to imagine my scheme less romantic,
and my views more probable, than they have hitherto appeared;
but believe me, my dearest sir, on my honour, I am no more elated
now than I was depressed 12 days ago, when things had a very dubious,
uncertain aspect. If I return, and if the queen should be
reinstated, I may, and I think, must be rewarded in some way&mdash;honorary,
or otherwise; but I depend on nothing, and hold it as
loose as ever I did; yet I now hope and believe I shall go back to
Zell, Hamburgh, and perhaps Copenhagen; but still I can positively
assert nothing till I have <em>His</em> reply and commands for my
departure.</p>

<p>Though I have this hundred pounds now in my possession, yet I
consider it a sacred deposit, not to be touched or infringed on till I
begin my journey from hence, or the expenses immediately necessary
to it. Even my own interest would lead me to be very scrupulous
and honourable on this point. My reward is not yet come: it
is to come, perhaps, bye-and-bye.</p>

<p>And now respecting the grand affair. I conversed two hours
with the baron this morning. He hopes to see his Majesty to-morrow
evening, or Wednesday morning. I then shall know his ultimate
pleasure and commands. The baron has, however, requested me to
write in cypher to the Danish nobility to-morrow, that "I have
received their money: that, according to all appearances and probability
I shall leave London on my return about the first day or
week in February, and shall take the direct road to Zell, and thence
to Hamburgh." He likewise writes the same to Her to-morrow. I
have drawn up a paper of articles to be presented to his Majesty by
the baron when he obtains audience, which will contain his reply
and argument. In my own opinion, I own, it seems as far as human
foresight can now determine, that I shall be sent away in the course
of next week: but nothing is sure, nothing to be depended on, till
his Majesty's answer and orders are known. Then, I've demanded
four days or five, to be ready and prepare my little affairs. A carriage
I must buy in Rotterdam or Utrecht, as no carriage can pass
by the packet from hence. I've a servant in readiness, whom I can
engage the minute I've my despatch or orders to be gone. 'Tis very
probable I shall be sent on from Hamburgh to Copenhagen, to give
notice then to the party of his Majesty's full consent. Then business
will begin. God grant it may be successful! If we are, I
may then presume to hope and think I shan't be forgotten.</p>

<p>I went to the baron. He was with the king last night, but the
queen being constantly at their elbow, he could not say one word to
<em>Him</em> respecting audience. The king said: "venez Mercredi à onze
heures." So, to-morrow morning, at 11, he will see Him. I asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
him if I might not, as 'twould be very agreeable to me in many respects,
stay till Monday next; he said "I <em>might</em> do it: but he
must request me not to stay beyond Friday, if it could be avoided
by acquiescence, as the Danish nobility, and the queen of Denmark,
would expect me impatiently according to my promise, and I should
not fail to execute it, if to be done. Besides, I am sure," said he,
"the king won't delay for an hour, and will expect you to begone
before next Monday. Pray be ready! I hope to send you word
to-morrow evening all is done. So try, if you can, to be ready for
Friday." I was obliged, therefore, to submit, and expect surely to
be gone next Friday afternoon, though then I shall be confoundedly
hurried and driven.</p>

<p>I am just returned from the baron's: I have received my ultimate

and lastly, the articles to which the king consents. All therefore is
done, finished completely. The baron wished me joy, bade me farewell,
wished me a very happy journey, and all success! I must,
'tis his Majesty's pleasure, begone to-morrow night for Harwich, and
must be at Harwich by or before 3 in the afternoon, as the packet
sails (unless the wind is directly contrary) Saturday evening.</p>

<p>Indeed, my dearest father, neither you nor I had any idea of the
tremendous roads through which I have passed, the continued and
wondrous chain of dangers, amid which I have as yet escaped unhurt.
Imagination cannot paint anything more horrid than the
roads of Westphalia, of Holland (beyond Utrecht), of Hanover, to
the gates of Zell. But let me continue my recital from Osnabrück.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
I quitted that city last Monday at noon, and got to Diepenau by
miracle almost next morning at daybreak. I would willingly have
gone round to Minden, or to Nienburg, two cities situate on the river
Weser, and at each of which there are bridges across it&mdash;but this
was impracticable. The river was so amazingly swelled by the
deluges of rain as to exceed all belief, and absolutely to cut off all
communication, in or out, with these two places. I had, therefore,
no partie left, but that of going on straight to Stolzenau, putting my
carriage into a boat, and crossing over at all events. I did so, and
succeeded. I arrived safe on the English bank of the Weser,
Thursday morning, after navigating more than a mile through fields
and meadows, the hedges of which only began to appear above water.
It put me in mind of Deucalion's deluge. Thence I had only 40
miles to Hanover. What signifies it to repeat to you that I expected
a hundred and a hundred times to be lost! That I passed deep
pieces of standing water, half a mile in length! That several times
I believed myself gone, and thought never to see Zell alive! Here
I am notwithstanding, unhurt, undismayed, and ready to meet these
dangers, if commanded, all again! Nor think that I am unmindful
of, or ungrateful to that Being, who protects the race of man, and
preserves us in every situation! I am not so wanting in the noblest
feeling of the human bosom; but as I feel, so I express myself
about it in very different language from you. I got here Friday
night by the kind assistance of the moon, without which 'twould
indeed have been an absolute impossibility ever to have got here in
the mire; since 'twould be neither more nor less than madness and
frenzy to attempt to travel during a dark night. You may depend
on it, my dear sir, I am not desired to do this, and never shall, till
the roads mend. As to the rest, I know your parental anxiety will
be all awake for me, and will make you tremble for my preservation;
but fear nothing. I have a noble presentiment which never quits
me, of future elevation! Some protecting genius shelters me from
danger, and averts every fatal accident from me. I have no doubt I
shall return to you bye-and-bye,&mdash;I cannot promise you a richer man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
but I can promise you, a wiser man. What passed last night I cannot
now mention to you. I may not trust to this uncertain, dangerous
conveyance. It is enough to say that all goes more than well,
that I am approved by my queen, that I am promised to share in
the future happy prospects, if we can realise them. That be my
endeavour! I have devoted myself to the enterprise. I have
passed the Rubicon, and won't retreat. If ever virtuous glory had
power to animate a young man's bosom, it ought to do so in mine!</p>

<p>This night, or rather early in the morning, by moonlight, I begin
my journey. It is only about 80 English miles; but I don't expect
to reach Hamburgh before Wednesday noon, as I shall only travel
during that part of the night when the moon lights me on the way.
You may depend, my dearest father, that I will indeed take every
care of my safety possible. They implore me here to do so. <em>She</em>
has laid her commands on me to be careful of myself, for <em>Her</em> sake.
What more forcible motives can I have? I half think I shall go
on to Copenhagen; but 'tis dangerous, and that point's not settled
yet. At Hamburgh I shall know all. Hitherto, all success attends
us: nor do I doubt that it will attend us to the end. "'Tis not in
mortals to command success:" we must do our utmost, and leave
the rest to fate.</p>

<p>And now, my best, kindest, dearest father, I bid you and my
mother farewell! I am just going to set out for Hamburgh. Pray
let me hear of her story from you: 'twill be very inspiriting to a
poor traveller, amid the horrid roads of Westphalia and Lower
Saxony.</p>

<p>I have received no money yet in repayment of the £100 I spent
last autumn; but <em>She</em> has not only promised me, in the fullest
terms, that sum, but superior marks of her bounty, if all goes
well. We must have patience, my dear father: time will do more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
for us than anything else. Hanbury wonders what the deuce has
brought me here. I told him I came by Osnabrück and Bremen,
and said not a word of Zell or Hanover. "You're a wicked fellow,"
he said to me. "You've done some mischief: some man's wife,
now, or some lady or other. You had better be candid, and tell me,
for your father will, I am sure, bye-and-bye." 'Twas just the pretext
I intended to screen myself with. So I told him that a little affair
of gallantry, harmless enough, had induced me just now to travel,
and that my intentions were for Berlin. <em>That</em> has satisfied him.</p>

<p>Now, to continue my narrative. I wrote you from Zell. I left
it on Sunday at midnight, and arrived, though through a thousand
hair-breadth escapes, at this place, the day before yesterday. The
country is an ocean. I passed through towns so completely environed,
as to resemble an island, amid a vast lake or sea. Guess,
then, what the roads must be. Surely, I am protected from any
harm in an extraordinary manner. I passed through waters so deep,
so long, so broad, that 'twas not in human nature to be quite unmoved.
I passed the Elbe very safely, about 20 miles higher up
than Hamburgh. 'Tis very, very happy, sir, yet here; for the rains
have begun afresh, and 'twill be impossible to travel for some time
in these countries. Here are not less than a dozen gentlemen now
in Hamburgh, who do not dare, though pressed by their affairs, to
set out for Holland and France. All the danger which threatened
us, is, however, over: aye, I believe I shan't quit this city this four
weeks or more, and then the spring will have mended the face of
things. I have seen the Danish nobleman to whom I am sent.
To-morrow we shall have a long interview. Then, as I can write
with more certainty, I'll finish this letter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center"><em>Feb.</em> 24.</p>

<p>At present, my dear sir, I am a little more in the light than I was
yesterday. I shall not assuredly be sent to Copenhagen, but remain
here at least 14 or 16 days, as a messenger is sent with what I
brought. What will be done in consequence I can't yet say; and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
I could, cannot communicate to you by this conveyance. Some few
weeks are requisite to ripen matters. I am promised on all hands
to have my fortune made if we succeed: but, as Hamlet says,
there's the rub! Meanwhile, they supply me with money for all my
expenses; so, at the worst, I am taken off your hands for the present.
Even that is somewhat, you must allow. My expectations
are neither languid nor sanguine. If they succeed, <em>She</em> neither can
nor will forget me. If they fail, <em>She</em> won't have it in her power.
That's exactly the case! So, I repeat, patience! The post which
ought to have arrived to-day from England is not come. No wonder,
when the rains continue, and all the country is deluged with
water. I am happy to find I shall have 15 days' respite from such
perilous journeys.</p>

<p>As the Baron de Lichtenstein had left orders for me to wait on
the Hanoverian Envoy with what letters I might have for his Majesty,
I waited on him this morning. He received me with distinguished
politeness. I gave him three letters; one from the queen,
one from the Danish nobility, and a third from myself; all addressed
to the king. He said he had received his orders to forward them
instantly to the queen's palace to his Majesty, which he would not
delay one moment. So, I suppose, in the course of 4 or 6 days I
shall receive some orders or message from <em>Him</em>. 'Tis a most delicate
and difficult affair in which they have engaged me; but, as I
exactly and minutely know my instructions, and the genius of the
party, I fear nothing; but, on the contrary, am conscious of being
able so to act, as to approve myself to those who have honoured me
by so noble a deputation. As soon as I know anything, I shan't fail
to inform you; but I shan't be surprised if I should be sent back
again to Germany in less than 12 or 14 days. Yet I know nothing,
and can draw no certain inferences at present. All depends on his
Majesty's replies and pleasure.</p>

<p>I would willingly give you a little light into the exact situation I
am in, and the views I have at this time. The nobility who sent
me back this second time to represent their requests, and notify
their desires to his Majesty, all men of the highest rank and eminence
in Denmark and Holstein, but being at present in a species
of exile, unpensioned and unofficed, were by no means capable of
raising a large sum of money, or supplying me with anything beyond
the "de quoi vivre." They only give me 600 ducats, or near £300
per an.:&mdash;I mean, after that proportion, during my stay in England
as their agent or envoy. It is not from them&mdash;I mean strictly, and
in their own persons&mdash;that my reward must ultimately come. It is
from her Majesty the queen. If she returns to her kingdom, she
can highly honour and reward me, herself. If she does not, she can
yet recommend me so powerfully to her brother, that I shall be at
least in some manner or way taken care of. I do not account the
money they give me to procure bread and wine, while employed in
their immediate service, as in the minutest degree rewarding me.
Neither do <em>they</em> esteem it so. Fond as I am of travelling, I am not
desirous of repassing the circle of Westphalia, at the continual
hazard of my life and limbs; nor would I do it in any cause less
honourable, less noble, than that of seeing a young and charming
princess, whose graciousness and condescension have attached me
more to her, than any hopes of interest or even ambition. Whether
his Majesty rejects or consents to their request, alters not in any
degree the intentions of the party. His consent will accelerate the
blow; his refusal may retard, but cannot, never will change the design.
They ordered me to tell <em>Her</em> Majesty&mdash;and I did tell her so&mdash;that
if the executioner should strike off ten heads, or if the plague
should destroy as many more&mdash;enough would still remain alive to
reseat her on the throne, and doubted not to effect it. The time
when cannot be fixed. It must depend on many circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Her Majesty has written to the king, particularly requesting him,
as the nobility are poor, and cannot allow me much, to make me
some genteel present while in England&mdash;not as any reward to me,
but to lighten their burden. Whether he will, however, comply with
this request, I very much question. If I hear nothing in 8 or 10
days, I shall write to her Majesty and the nobility, and request
them to send more minute and precise commands how to proceed.
But surely I shall hear from the king in some way or other within
that time; at least, I can't but apprehend so.</p>

<p>I sent the three letters to his Majesty last Friday. I've yet heard
nothing in answer. If I hear nothing in ten days from this time, I
shall then write to two of the nobility, and likewise to the queen
(for she expressly and personally enjoined me to write to Herself,
and to address all my letters immediately to her). This gracious
and condescending permission I won't fail to profit by. If his
Majesty sees me, and gives me a favourable answer to the request
made him, I think, I believe, and imagine, he will send me instantly
back with it to Zell and Hamburgh. Nay, the Queen has even requested
him in her letter, in that case, to honour me with some employ,
or charge me with some ostensible message or commission, to
hide my real and actual errand. Her Majesty, in the last interview
I had with her at midnight, in an apartment of the castle of Zell,
where I was brought disguised, was most graciously pleased to
assure me that it was not only on account of my services that she would
endeavour to reward me, but that she was even <em>personally</em> attached
to a man who would have rushed on certain death, to have had the
glory of sacrificing his life at such a shrine.</p>

<p>I have finished my packet for Germany to the nobility, but I don't
write to her Majesty till Tuesday next, as 'tis not impossible I may
hear from his Majesty in or within that time. My motive for not
quitting town before next Sunday se'nnight is, that I would wait a
decent, proper time, in expectation of an answer, message, or order
from the king, who may be hindered by business, &amp;c., and who
would, doubtless, think me very inattentive to the queen's concerns,
and my so important commission, if I ran away in a week after my
arrival to visit my friends, regardless of him or his reply. Even if
I hear not a word, direct or indirect, yet, when I leave London, I
shall put into the Hanoverian Envoy's hand a few lines, which, if
his Majesty should send for me, or ask after me, during my absence,
he will, in that case, send or deliver to his Majesty. What I shall
say will be to this purport:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Not having received any message from your Majesty, and
not having seen my father or friends these eighteen months, and
not being immediately wanted in London on account of my commission,
I have presumed to leave town; but am ready at a moment's
notice, and the signification of your Majesty's pleasure, to be again
in London with all possible expedition.</p>

<p>This I shall give myself to the Hanoverian Envoy, and request
him to give me a line to Bristol, the instant he receives any message
respecting me from his Majesty, as, if wanted, I will, and shall hold
myself in readiness, to return to town without delay. This conduct
will, I think, obviate any censure or disapproval.</p>

<p>My stay, as I said yesterday, won't, I believe, exceed, if it reaches,
three weeks, as I expect within that time from my quitting London,
answers to my letters to Hamburgh and Zell, which will require my
return to town. I may even have letters sooner, so important as to
keep me here, or necessitate me, if at Bristol, to return directly; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
I think I shall have none sent; though, truly, I can't say. It depends
on the course of events in Denmark and Germany.</p>

<p>I think the king won't see me first or last, as envoy from the
queen and nobility; but I hope, that is, I half hope, that he'll, notwithstanding,
pay some sort of attention to her Majesty's recommendation
of me, and somehow or other, perhaps serve me, or employ
me, or reward me&mdash;but yet I doubt much even of that. If my
fortune depended on the queen's goodness and gratitude (for I have
served her, and will with my life, if she bid me), my life upon it,
she would not leave me unprovided for. But she can do nothing.
Even if she should be restored, yet 'tis the king of England must
employ me. I neither could nor would profit by the Danish Majesty's
service. But we must leave all that to time. I expect nothing,
nothing at all; but I may have great things done for me.
The latter won't give me one moment's pain, the former not an hour's
exultation. I have told you I am in <em>omnia paratus</em>. Death or a
ribbon are to me the same.</p>

<p>Imagine, my dear father, the shock I have received on hearing
this moment, on my arrival here, that the Queen of Denmark is
dead. I am wrapt in horror, sorrow, and consternation. I went to
St. James's Coffee House, where Lord Hertford confirmed to me the
sad news. A purple fever carried her off. The courier arrived
yesterday, late at night. His Majesty is said to be much hurt by
this so unexpected a blow. No doubt remains of its unhappy authenticity.
As to me, indeed, I feel as I ought, the loss I sustain by
her Majesty's death. I was even attached to her, and interest conspires
in the nobler emotions to make me weep at the funeral of so
young, so amiable, so unhappy a queen. What will be the consequences
to me I can't say exactly. That she should die at this cri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>tical
time, at the very moment, when she would, no doubt, have
recommended me so strongly to the king, is one of those events
which may overcome a temper more steady and uniform than mine.</p>

<p>No wonder now that I have no answer to the long letter which I
addressed to her three or four weeks ago, and which she graciously
assured me at my departure from Zell, she would certainly answer.
My head sinks for a moment under this very unexpected stroke; but
it is really sorrow, more than the mean consideration of self loss,
that bend it down. True, I have lost my patroness, my royal mistress;
but, I have a hundred times told you, that no accidents of
fortune can permanently stagger me. I am prepared to live or die;
to be prosperous, or to stem the tide of adversity&mdash;yet, I confess it
lies heavy at my heart. I must have done.</p>

<p>To-morrow I'll write more, be assured. Don't you be hurt, my
dear father at this news! Fear not for me. I can't be depressed.
His Majesty may yet patronise me; nay, I fear not that he will do
it. My spirit is unbroken, and ten times defeated I shall rally, and
conquer in the end.</p>

<p>Good night! I weep for the poor departed queen. Little did I
think this, when she so kindly bade me adieu, not two months since,
in her library at midnight. I remember her parting words, her
look. She held the door a moment in her hand before she went
out. But I did not see, I did not know that death followed her
step, and shut the door for ever between her and me.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Lord Lumley (Lord Harborough's son) told me 'tis believed
the queen was poisoned.</p>

<p>I have this very moment received a mournful letter from Baron
de Seckendorf, from Zell. I join my tears to his, on the loss of
our royal mistress, the gracious and amiable deceased queen. He
says, the Baron de Lichtenstein pledges himself that I shall be at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
least reimbursed my expenses from his Majesty here. He mentions
no circumstances of her Majesty, the queen's death. He was too
much oppressed with sorrow. Depend on it, that in the end some
notice from the throne will be taken of me. It must be so, I think.</p>

<p>No letter yet from the poor, miserable, thunderstruck nobility
at Hamburgh.</p>

<p class="center">L<span class="smcap">ONDON</span>, <em>May</em> 26, 1775.</p>

<p>I have written, finished, sealed up, and put in the post this evening,
three very particular and minute letters. One to the Baron
de Lichtenstein, requesting him to recommend me to his Majesty,
which I know he will do, and which will be almost as effectual as the
deceased queen's recommendation. A second to Baron de Seckendorf,
answering his letter to me, and desiring him to strengthen my
request made to Lichtenstein. This, I know likewise, he'll do most
cheerfully. I have also desired him to send me the particulars of
her Majesty's illness and death. The third letter, and longest, is to
the Danish nobility at Hamburgh. You may almost divine its
general meaning and contents. I condole with them on our horrid
loss in the dear departed queen: inform them I have written to
Lichtenstein, to the end that he may do his utmost, and what she
would have done, if she had only lived a few days longer, with his
Britannic Majesty. I offer them my further offices, if they have
anything to employ me in. I request the continuance of their
friendship, and to hear from them soon. This is, in general terms,
the substance of my letter.</p>

<p>I allow, my dear father, that I am generally too sanguine in my
expectations, too enthusiastic and lively in my ideas and descriptions;
but yet remember I predict it&mdash;something must, and will yet
be done effectual for me, by the Danish nobility and Baron de
Lichtenstein. They are all conscious of and acquainted with my
services; feeling satisfied of my zeal, capacity, and address, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
extremely desirous of procuring me some reward, some sort of recompense
for my dangers, fatigues, and endeavours. The Baron de
Lichtenstein managed the whole affair, knows me, esteems me:
knows her Majesty the queen's intentions of serving me with her
brother: and, superadded to all this, he is vastly beloved by the
king, who showed him a thousand marks of goodness when in England.</p>

<p>Attend the answer to their letters: they will come in three or
four weeks. I cannot, indeed, answer for his Majesty's conduct in
consequence of their recommendations; nor could I, even if the
queen had recommended me: but I think I may rely on their warm
endeavours to procure me some notice or reward from his Majesty;
though what may be, whether greater or smaller, must depend on
his gracious pleasure.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, my dear sir, when I reflect on the so unexpected,
so sudden, so critical death, of the poor, amiable, unhappy queen, I
am covered with amazement, and own it is a lesson <em>never to depend
on anything</em>. Could anything not actually done be surer? A young,
gay, healthy woman, who had every appearance of long life, snatched
away in four days, and buried ere we imagined she was ill. Probably,
if I live to a hundred years, I shall never meet with another,
so wondrous, so extraordinary an adventure, which is so incredible in
its own nature, that I know not what to say to it.</p>

<p>I have received, my very dear father, a long and mournful letter
from the Baron de Bülow himself. You will see from it how ready
the nobility are to do any and every thing to conduce to my interests:
how sensible they are of my zeal, capacity, and unwearied
fidelity in the execution of their commands. I have already named
the service, the only service, they can do me. I mean that of requesting
Baron de Lichtenstein to write very strenuously in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
favour to his Majesty. I shall reply to-morrow or next day to this
letter, and condole with them on our common, heavy, and irreparable
loss, in the dear, departed queen, and reiterate to them my urgent
request of being recommended to his Majesty, as the only recompense
I desire or ask. There is no shadow of doubt that they will
do their part. There is no doubt in nature of Lichtenstein's doing
his; but as to what notice our royal master may be pleased to take
of their recommendation, or how far he may be graciously disposed
to extend his favour or notice to this, I cannot presume or pretend
to say, but must leave to futurity to determine. That I shall be
reimbursed seems clear; but that's nothing. I aspire much beyond
any pecuniary reward. Even if his Majesty should not <em>now</em> extend
his munificence or protection to me, yet I am at least known to him
by character and reputation. I have served without any reward his
royal sister&mdash;I have claims&mdash;and some future time may give me
opportunity to renew or make them good.</p>

<p>[It may be added that the Danish nobility wrote a letter to
George III., in which they formally renounced and refused all repayment
of the sums disbursed in the cause of the queen's restoration:
which repayment was expressly stipulated by his Britannic
Majesty, in the third article of the conditions which Mr. Wraxall
carried over to Germany in February, 1775. They only asked that
their agent might be honourably rewarded and employed. But it
was all of no avail.]</p>

<p>Having had nothing material to communicate to you since your
departure from hence, I would not trouble you with my letters till I
did hear from you, in consequence of our agreement, and now I find
myself honoured with your's of the 22nd November and 5th December;
both which, for reason of the early frost, and constant
easterly wind, I did not receive but lately, and at a short distance
from one another. I congratulate you <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'verry'">very</ins> heartily upon the shortness
of your passage, and happy arrival in London, and beg you'll
accept of my sincere thanks for the friendly expressions of your
letters, and the intelligence you are so obliging to impart to me. I
make not the least doubt but you'll be able to employ your time a
great deal better, and enjoy quite other pleasures in that great
world, where you must almost be lost in, than you did in our little
trading town of Hambro'. The inclosed letters which you transmitted
to me, have been deliver'd according to your direction.
You'll certainly hear from Mr. Holland directly. Mr. and Mrs.
Matthiessen and their family, have often enquired for you, are verry
glad of the intelligence I gave them from you, and that they may
expect to see you, perhaps, in a short time, back again in those
quarters, and do return their best compliments to you. I am glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
to hear that Garrick approves of the new play that is intended to
be performed; but cannot help wondering at the same time of his
backwardness of concurring more effectually in its execution; but
this may perhaps comme in time, when he has more particularly digested
the plan, and seen the first actors in motion. You don't tell
me of having seen him yourself: this is, however, what I could have
wished, as you are by far better able than Woodward to give him a
clear idea of the whole, and remove such objection as he could have
to it. I have not yet heard from Beard, tho' I suppose, he must
be in correspondence with Holland. As to Foote, I had no letters
from him, and none did I expect; as we agreed, before his departure,
that he should not write, but when circumstances did absolutely
require it. Do you think that Shutter will have orders to advance
the performance of this play on the stage he is at this time engaged
on, or that Garrick will, perhaps, chose somebody else for
having the management of it there. I cannot tell you anything
more on this subject till things are come to maturity. Meanwhile,
if you hear of something which you think will be worth transmitting,
I'll be obliged to you for the communication of it. Our German
plays are interrupted till the beginning of February, and the
Cristmass vacancies won't allow the balls at the Boselhoff till the
latter end of this month. Last week I heard at a verry grand concert
the famous violin player, Lolly, who is, perhaps, the greatest
virtuoso on that instrument at present in Europe. It is said he'll
visit Engeland, where, I dare say, he'll be as much admired as in the
other places he has been. You don't tell me how you deal with
pleasures and amusements; for my part, my dear friend, I catch as
much of the sweets of life as time and circumstances will alow.
You must take up with this dish of broken English as it is, and
excuse the inaccuracies of it, provided only you are able to understand
it. Let me hear from you, and believe me, at all events, your
devoted humble servant and friend.</p>

<p>I have received consecutively, and very safely, four of your letters.
The first from Z&mdash;&mdash;, the second from Rotterdam, and the two last
ones, from yᵉ 14th and 21st instant, from London, which give me
a circumstantial account of your journey, and your transactions after
your arrival at the last mention'd place. I should have answer'd
them by the post of last Friday, if it had not been for the absence
of Holland, who having been down to his estates for about 12 days,
and beeing only return'd yesterday, it was only this morning I could
communicate to him the contents of your last two letters. He is
extremely satisfied; as, indeed, he ought to be, of the activity, the
zeal, skil, and affection, with which you embrac'd and acted in the
cause of Mrs. Yates, and pitty's only that all the trouble you have
taken, and our endeavours, cannot prevail on Garrick's obstinacy to
act his part in the <em>manner</em> the other actors desire it, in the new intended
play, which may possibly be deficient in succes, in case he
should persist in his refusal. As we have no intelligence as yet from
Woodward or Beard (which we expect, however, every moment), we
can form no judgment about his intentions, and therefore we are as
little able to give you a cathegorical answer upon your question,
whether we can make any further use of your services, or not? and,
besides having no true account of the state of affairs from the stage
where the play is to be acted. If the comedians have not been interrupted,
if they know their parts, if the stage is adapted, if the
machinery's are readdy, &amp;c., of which I doubt very much. You must
remember that at your departure things did not look very bright,
and that we were in apprehension of some disagreable news. Tho'
we don't know the circumstances of what has happened there, and
tho' the pot is not entirely <em>crack'd</em>, or has not <em>boil'd over</em>, as a certain
person express'd itself, something must, however, have been the
matter, and discomposed for the present the arrangements that were
made, as <em>Mr. Reddish</em>, and two others of the first actors, have left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
the playhouse, and undertook a journey during this summer to the
south of Germany, till the suspicions that probably have been raised
are dissipated, and the difficulty's they met with have been removed,
which we hope will be towards the winter, when they will all meet
again on the stage to make a fresh rehearsal, of which the success
may be less doubtfull, if Garrick will second them as he ought.
But be the case what it will, we expect every day, and certainly in
the course of next weak, ours and your good friend, <em>Mr. Foote</em>, who
will certainly relieve us of our anxiety, clear our doubts, and lead us
in the way to give you a clear and positive decision. Till then, my
dear, good friend, you must be quiet, and remain where you are
without taking any resolution (exept on Garrick's immediate orders).
This is what Holland entreats you to mind till he has explained himself
with Foote, which, as you see, will be very soon, assuring you
upon his honour, that his first business will be to settle with him in
what manner to employ you, and then to give you immediate and
positive resolution if you are to continue in the same station, and
send you a draught at the same time; or in case you were at present
of no use for to bring the play on the stage, to entreat Mrs. Yates
(who is already acquainted with your ability's), in the strongest terms
to recommand you to her friend, Mr. Garrick. This, my dear friend,
is all I can, and am commissioned to say to you upon this account.
I hope my next will be more satisfactory to you; meanwhile be assured
that Holland, as well as myself, we have the highest and best
grounded esteem for your noble and disinterested way of thinking,
and whatever be the event, we shall always congratulate ourself of
having made your acquaintance, and cemented your friendship.</p>

<p>Holland begs to be excused in not writing to you himself, as he
is extremely fatigued of his journey, and troubled with a vast deal
of business which he found at his return; he begs you'll be so good
to secure for him the chariot you have bespoke, for which he'll send
you the draught you require. I am extremely satisfied with the
manner in which you communicate to me what intelligence you give
us, and which I understand perfectly. I wish mine were as intelligible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
to you, which however I doubt of. Be so good, my dear friend,
to continue in the same way, but observe at the same time, when
you make the cover to Mr. Matthiessen, to lay a small bit of paper
between the seal of my letters and Matthiessen cover, as one of
them stuck so fast to it that it was tore to pieces in the opening of
it, but happily there remained just so much of the seal that it could
not be opened.</p>

<p>I'll be oblig'd to you for the books; my mother, brothers, sister,
and her children, make their best compliments to you, and wish you
health and pleasure. So do I do likewyse, my dear friend; farewell,
and remember your devoted friend and servant.</p>

<p>By my next you shall have more, and perhaps a little tit-tat,
which time won't allow at present.</p>

<p>I received in due time your favour of yᵉ 13th of June, which
was soon followed by that of yᵉ second of the same month, accompanying
a parcel of silk, and four books, three of which I delivered
according to your orders, and kept the fourth to myself, as you desir'd
me. Be so good to receive my most gratefull acknowledgement
for this mark of your friendship. I have not yet found time sufficient
to go through it with due attention, but I'll reserve the perusal
of it for those hours which free from business I can devote to friendship,
and shall look upon it as a conversation which cannot but
afford me a great deal of pleasure, as anything that comes from the
author will always be dear to me. When I deliver'd the silk to
Holland, I communicated to him the contents of your first of the
13th of June; he join'd with me in his commendations with regard
to your noble and disinterested way of thinking, and acknowledged
the justness of your expectations with respect to Garrick. He
assures you of the continuation of his friendship and esteem, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
desir'd me to tell you that he made repeated applications to <em>Beard</em>,
for insisting with <em>Woodward</em> to recommand you to Garrick's remembrance;
so that I don't doubt but you'll have heard by this time of
something beeing done for you, the news of which will be most
heartily wellcome to me, you may be assured. Foote has left this
place some time ago; but he is soon to return, in order to be married
to a young and amiable lady, one of the first family's of this
country. He jointly with <em>Holland</em>, is in hopes that you have burnt
all the letters and papers which you have received from the latter
one, as well as from Miss Bonneval, respecting the unhappy affair
that was the object of your correspondence; and they beg that you'll
be so kind to confirm them in these hopes, for their future quiet and
tranquillity. I expect, my dear friend, not only to receive of your
letters, before you leave England, but even during your new intended
travels, when you'll be at leisure, and your thaughts will bring you
back to this place, where you have undoubtedly left a great many
friends, some of which are strongly attach'd to you, and more particularly
Bonneval's family. They all of them beg that you'll accept
of their best compliments and hearty wishes for your wellfare.</p>

<p>It is with astonishment and sorrow I have read in the several
papers the account of the bloody scene exhibited in America. Is it
possible that the spirit of <em>rebellion</em> (for as far as I am able to judge
I cannot call it <em>liberty</em>) has raised their madness so far as to make
them run blindly to their destruction? for what will be the consequence
of all this? a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'shokking'">shocking</ins> bloodshed between <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'childern'">children</ins> of the
same mother, a total destruction of their property, and the utter
ruin of all commerce and trade in those parts of the world, while a
storm is preparing at this side of the water, which may perhaps
strike a fatal blow to Old England, without being able to prevent it.
What would become of Brittain's grandeur, if this great Spanish
Armada was intended on your coasts, or on some of your American
settlements? This opinion gains generally ground here, and few
people think this undertaking to be only for the barbarian coast.
But what is still more astonishing, is the spirit of division that prevails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
in the metropolis, and the outrageous conduct of part of its
citisents; nothing remains but they should likewise take up arms, in
order to render the scene compleat. I pitty with all my heart those
who are at the helm; and from my peaceable hermitage (which you
have seen), when stretched upon my sopha, I cannot help smiling at
the reading of your brilliant regattas and sommer diversions, amidst
all those clamours, and while half of the nation is under arms, or
preparing themselves to be so. But enough of this. <em>Comment vont
les plaisirs</em>, and <em>les amours</em>? I wish you success in both. God
bless you, my dear sir; remember him who is very cordialy your
devoted humble friend and servant.</p>

<p>It was not but yesterday I receiv'd your's of yᵉ 21st July, as
we had then two mails due from England, and much about the same
time, or a little after you have dispatch'd it, my last (which was
wrote about the middle of the same month) must have come to your
hands, if it did come at all, for I cannot account for its delay, having
desired my sister to have it put in the Post Office. I gave you an
account in it of the several applications Holland had made on your
behalf to Beard, relative to Woodward's putting Garrick in mind of
you; the assurances we had got from Beard of his having acted
according to his promiss, and the ignorance we then were in of its
success. I have only the time to acquaint you now, that I saw Holland
this morning, who told me of Beard mentioning in a letter he
had lately receiv'd, that he hoped to have in a few days something
to communicate to him about you. That he, Holland, is expecting
this intelligence with the greatest impatience, and that as soon as
he shall have received it, he will immediately do himself the pleasure
of writing to you, in order to acquaint you of it. But, my dear
sir, how are we to act in directing our letters to you? as I see it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
your intention to set out from England after the 14th of this month.
At all events I'll direct what I have to send to you at the direction
you left me at your departure, and which I make use of now, in the
supposition that you'll leave such orders that anything will be transmitted
to you. I have likewise to acknowledge the favour of your
former, including a column of the newspapers, for the communication
of which I am most sincerely oblig'd to you. I find this
account wrote with elegance, and that warm interest the subject requir'd,
and don't doubt it will answer the intention it was design'd
with. You see, my dearest friend, that our ignorance is the sole
cause of our silence, and thus I hope you'll be persuaded to pardon
it, and not adscribe it to ingratitude and oblivion, which are sentiments
that will never find entrance in our breast; but, on the contrary,
be assured that we wish nothing with more ardor then to see
you happy, and to see you rewarded, as you deserve it, by someboddy
else, it beeing not in our power to effect it, but by our repeated intercessions,
which I still hope will have their effect. I must finish
here, in order not to miss the time of the post office. Thus farewell,
and remember him who is with the sincerest affection your
devoted friend and servant.</p>

<p>Not only, my dearest friend, several little excursions in the country,
but also our friend Holland's absence, who did return only since
a couple of days, have prevented my answering immediately the
very kind letter which you favour'd me with on the 18th of January.
It gave me an uncommon pleasure to hear of you, after so long a
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'scilence'">silence</ins>, which I could very well account for, as I knew that you was
again on a visit on the Continent. I understand that you did not
follow your first plan of crossing the Pirrenean mountains, and going
to the south of Spain, for else you would have received a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
which I directed to you at Madrid, <em>a la poste restante</em>, in September
last, as we did agree. If it be lost, there is no great news in it, as
it contain'd nothing material. It was only <em>une lettre d'amitié</em>, and
an enquiry after your health, with a short account of our doing here
in the usual stile.</p>

<p>I give you my most sincere thanks for the sentiments of friendship
and affection which you honour me with; be assured of the
most hearty return, not only from me, but likewise from our friends
Holland and Foote, and of the gratefull sense we do all retain of
your noble and generous behaviour. Believe me, dear sir, that it
gives us the greatest pain and sorrow to hear that nothing has been
done as yet on your behalf from Garrick's side, notwithstanding
Beard's strong recommendations thro' Woodward's channel. Beard
expresses his astounishment at it as well as Holland, and we are entirely
at a loss how to account for Garrick's neglect, in not making
you a return so justly deserved, and which can come from <em>him</em> only.
I do not doubt a moment of Woodward having made all possible
applications, and in that supposition, the critical circumstances of
Garrick's own affairs, and the hurry and perplexity he has been in,
can alone account for his behaviour. Holland desires that you will
be assured of his esteem, of his attachment and friendship for you,
and how much he wishes to convince you of those sentiments, nothing
will be able to efface them out of his heart; and the same I
dare answer for Foote, whom we have not seen since last summer,
but who is expected here at the beginning of August. As all the
hopes of renewing a theatrical entertainement are entirely dropt,
you may easily imagin that Beard and Holland do but seldom correspond
together, and yet only on friendly terms.</p>

<p>I wish that the presenting the prints may open the way of helping
you to Garrick's remembrance, and if means could be found out
of being presented to him yourself, this, I dare say, would be of
more effect.</p>

<p>I paid for the hire of the carriage at Utrecht according to your
desire. Caillé had an opportunity to send hither a person of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
acquaintance, to whom I paid the money, and who gave me a receipt
for it, so that this point is settled.</p>

<p>I was extremely welcome to my mother and brother, and likewyse
to Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;'s family, with the news of having received a letter
from you. They were greatly rejoiced at hearing you were well, and
safe return from your late excursion. They beg you'll accept of the
return of their best compliments, and hearty sallutation to you.
Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; had the misfortune of loosing again two childern last
winter, but three weeks ago she was brought to bed of a boy; this
does partly make up the former loss. However, her constitution is
much hurt, and she enjoys but very little health.&mdash;I would be much
obliged to you, if at your leisure moments you would favour me with
a short account of your late excursion, and how you was pleased in
that tour; for such an attentive traveller as you are, I dare say nothing
will have escaped your inspection. I must acknowledge to
you that I am tired with the sedentary life I lead here, and the insignificant
business I am employ'd in; and between you and me I
have made application of beeing sent to England; in how far I shall
be able to succeed in this attempt I cannot tel, however, I have
some hopes. How happy should I be if I could have the pleasure
of meeting you in England, and embracing him whom I esteem and
love with all my heart. This, my dear sir, you may be assured of
from your affectionate and most devoted friend and servant.</p>

<p>You must pardon me, my dear friend, if I deferred returning an
immediate answer to your kind letter of yᵉ 30th July. Holland's
absence, and Foote not being at that time arrived, put it out of my
power to give you a satisfactory one, before I had seen either of them.
They are both here now, and have retain'd for you the same sentiments
of friendship and esteem which you have impress'd them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
with at the beginning of our mutual acquaintance. They acknowledge
the justice of your claim on their warmest interest and recommendation
on your behalf. They were even beforehand in offering
to renew them, and to do anything in their power which might be of
further service to you; but they cannot help beeing surprised that all
their wishes and join'd endeavours with Beard, have hitherto been
unsuccessfull on that subject. How is it possible that Garrick, who
makes pretention on feeling and sentiments, can be regardless to
the services you intended him, and in which you have so effectually
been employed? This strange behaviour is above their conception.
However, as they are willing to account for this, more than seeming,
neglect, on behalf of the hurry of business, and the many vexations
he has labour'd under this year past, they hope that repeated application
will be of better effect. Foote, you will remember, has never
been in any direct intercourse with Beard or Woodward. But Holland
not only accepted writing again in the strongest terms, but told
me that having had some time ago a <em>rendez-vous</em> with <em>Beard</em>, you
took up great part of their conversation, in which he dwelt upon the
absolute necessity that something ought to be done for you, and that
they both would write to Woodward on that subject; so that you
may be sure, my dear friend, if their goodwill can have any effect,
and their recommendation any weight upon Garrick, you cannot,
with the help of your friends in England, fail of being successful in
your attempt to get a place, the intelligence of which will give me,
as you may easily guess, the most complete satisfaction; and so I
am positive it would also to Foote and Holland, who, I can assure
you, do lament at each time that I do mention you to them, their
incapacity of serving you according to their heart's desire, and do
constantly express in the most distinguished expression, their high
esteem for your personal quality's and noble way of thinking, and
their perfect gratitude for your behaviour in general. Those sentiments
they will certainly never part with; and they beg that you
will do them the favour to continue that friendship for them, of which
you have given them such uncontestable proofs; and give me leave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
my dear friend, to join my request to theirs, that I may retain the
same share in your remembrance.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. M&mdash;&mdash;, and their family, are highly pleased, as
well as my mother and brother, to hear of you; they desire that
you'll be so good to accept of their best compliments. Mr. Mathias
is very much obliged to you for your kind remembrance, wishes you
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'blank'">a</ins> great deal of good, and gives his best salutes to you.</p>

<p>I will be vastly obliged to you for the new production of your pen,
which you are so good to promiss me. I wait for them with impatience,
as they will in a manner make me amends for our separation,
and let me enjoy your company, at least, in idea.</p>

<p>I have but little hopes remaining of beeing successful in my application
for a change in my situation. Tho' I do not give them up
entirely for the future, I cannot flatter myself for the present of
being so happy to make a trip to Albion, unless some unexpected
events would open the way for it.</p>

<p>I perceive that the last disagreable news from the North American
Continent, have but little influence on the uninterrupted pleasures
of your town. However, the success of the present civil war
cannot fail of drawing the most serious consequences at their issue,
and of bringing on a prodigious change in a great many fortunes.
Well! but let them fight and quarrel as long as they please, I won't
much trouble my head about it; but I will ever be ready to convince
you that I am sincerely,</p>

<p>I can now very easily account, my dear friend, for Beard's silence
with regard to your last letter. His absence from his ordinary
place of abode, is undoubtedly the only reason of your having been
without any news from him since the latter end of June. He has
made a tour to Saxony, where he intended staying two or three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'monts'">months</ins>, but would be back towards the end of this month; this is
what I could learn from our friend Holland, who has likewise been
a very long time without his letters (their litterary intercourse being
now almost dropt). He thinks your letter cannot be lost, but supposes
it has been left at Z&mdash;&mdash;, or only been sent of late to him
on his tour; so that you will have receiv'd now, or will probably in
a short time, the answer you expected; meanwhile you may, my
dear sir, make yourself very easy about the fate of your letter, which
certainly cannot be lost. Surprising it is that all applications made
on your behalf have hitherto been without effect; nevertheless, I
am of opinion you must not give up the hope of success; a favourable
moment will probably come, and Woodward will no doubt sease
it to remind Garrick of your services. I cannot help having some
apprehensions with regard to your intention, which you communicate
to me in your last letter, of putting in order the anecdotes relative
to Mrs. Yates, in a kind of memoirs; not, my dear sir, that I
have the least doubt of your prudence and discretion; but you must
know how easily an unforeseen accident may happen which can
occasion the los of such a paper, which falling in other hands would
certainly be published to the world, and what would be the consequence
for those who have had any share in its contents? at least
you will, no doubt, keep their names to yourself, and interwow the
whole in such a manner, that it must remain untelligible to all those
who are no knowing ones. I leave this to your caution, and we all
depend upon your known prudence. Both Holland and Foote, who
is return'd about a fortnight ago, where his business does call him
in the winter time, desire that you'll be assured of their everlasting
friendship and esteem.</p>

<p>All your acquaintances here present their best compliments to
you. There is since a couple of days a general rumor here of an
approaching war. This will to all appearances occasion some more
activity in trade, as well as in polliticks. Adieu, my dear friend; I
wish you health and pleasure, and beg you will believe me very sincerly
and faithfully, yours.</p>

<p class="p5">No. 8.</p>

<p>Yours, my dear friend, of yᵉ 26th Nov. and 5th Dec., arrived at
one and the same day, as we had three English mails due, owing to
the east wind that has constantly blown this long while; and as I
have desired, once for all, that any letter which comes from you
should remain at my mother's house till I come to fetch it in person;
they were not delivered to me till the day before yesterday, so
that you must not be surprised at having received no immediate
answer to them.</p>

<p>So agreeable your letters have hitherto been to me, so very deeply
has the last one affected me. The intelligence you give me, and
which accounts at the same time for the presentation of the memoirs
in question to Garrick, has afflicted me beyond expression. You cannot,
you must not doubt, my dearest friend, of the part I take in the
most minutest thing that may interest your wellfare. How should
I not feel for your concerns? but at the same time how great are
you in my Eeyes, how great must you be in the Eeyes of those who
are acquainted with your principles, with the motives that do lead
you in this occasion? Be assured that if anything could add to the
esteem which you have commanded from me, from Holland and
Foote, it would be the disclosure you have now made. I do conceive
how it could have hurt your pride with narrow-minded souls;
but with us it cannot. Men of honour and feeling, like you, are
much above the caprices of fortune, and I am assured that its inconsistencies
cannot in any degree affect their way of thinking. We
have too many proofs of your strickt honour, disinterestedness, and
even self-denial, to harbour the least doubt of any change of sentiment
on your side. Not indeed, be easy on that account. Far from
disapproving your plan, I would be the first to advise it; so does
Holland, so would Foote. Happy we would be if we had interest
enough with Garrick to contribute to its success. You know, my
dear friend, how deeply we are obliged to you, and how much we
have wished to convince you of our gratitude; but, at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
time how unsuccessfull all our endeavours and applications have
been. I approve much of your letting Woodward know of your
intended plan; he must, and certainly will back it by his interest,
and I hope that this will do at least. We have almost lost sight of
him, and so likewise of Beard; I don't even know with certitude if
he is returned, tho' I suppose he must be so at this time. Holland,
who is very sickly, and has been so the whole winter, has not received
any letters from him since his departure. Foote is return to
the capital, as I told you, and will not visit our quarters before next
summer.</p>

<p>Do believe me, my dear friend, that I don't mind any loss of time
or expence in our intercourse. I wish to hear from you; your letters
are always wellcome to me, and give me a particular satisfaction.
This will reach you by the new direction you have given me, and at
the same time you'll receive two lines by the former way in order to
acquaint you of it. Let me know by your first which of the two I
shall keep for the future. All your friends here return their best
compliments to you, and wish you well. So does he who is very
sincerely and affectionately yours.</p>

<p>It is a long time since I had any of your letters, and it will be
near the same that I did not do myself the pleasure of writing to
you. What is become of you since, and what has been the success
of your application with Garrick? Those, my dear sir, are natural
questions from the part of him that interests himself so warmly for
you as I do. It would afford me the greatest pleasure if you could
see the accomplishment of your desires. Mine did not succeed
according to the hopes I had form'd. I have been obliged to relinquish
the idea of beeing employed at London, having lately been
nominated to the post of Resident at Dantzig, where I expect to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
setled towards the end of this year; but first I'll be obliged to go
to C&mdash;&mdash;, and intend setting out next week thither. So, my dear
friend, that if you do me the pleasure of giving me some news of
your welfare, you wil be so good to direct them, during the remainder
of this year, at our old direction, where I have given orders that
your letters should be kept til my return. You'll however observe
not to mention anything of the old topic in them, for fear of their
miscarrying, and when I shal have reach'd my new destination, I'll
give you another direction for the future, for I should be glad to
cultivate our correspondence, and the friendship which has subsisted
between us. Be assured, my dear friend, that where ever my
fate may dispose of me, I shall desire the continuance of it, for him
that is for ever with a sincere esteem, your devoted friend and
servant.</p>

almost every German custom and institution,

anything of his writings, equivalent only
to saying that he has written two volumes.
He has now left English for German life;
so far, at least, as Saxony offers a specimen
of it, and his descriptions are characterised
by the same graphic, uncompromising, and,
one is bound to say, moreover, studded,
as usual, by gems of wit, humour and

of Munich life, political, social, and artistic.
'Social Life in Munich' is entirely free
from the scandalous anecdotes by which

Written throughout in a pleasing lively

he amuses his own countrymen."</p>

Its object is to reconcile Theism with the

a rational, as opposed to irrational, Positivism."</p>

<p>T<span class="smcap">HE</span> T<span class="smcap">IMES</span>.&mdash;"The new history of the
lyrical drama with which Mr. Sutherland
Edwards favours the public, has three
qualities to recommend it. In the first
place, it contains, for its size, a very complete
account of the progress of an art,
which now, beyond all others, occupies the
attention of the civilized world; in the
second place, it is one of those treasures of
amusing anecdote that may be taken up
and laid down at a moment's notice; in the
third place, it abounds with the observations
of a shrewd and independent thinker,
who has seen much, read much, and
travelled much, and who approaches his
subject less as a professed musician than as
one of those cultivated men who take a
position between the artist and the multitude,
and who, after all, constitute the
body upon whom the general appreciation
of every art depends.... The anecdotes,
which we have given in illustration
of an extremely short and inglorious period
of operatic history, occupy but very few
pages in Mr. Edwards' book; and, when we
inform our readers that his two volumes are
replete with matter of the same kind, they
will easily judge of the amount of entertainment
to be derived from his labours.
So abundant is his material, that he might,
if he had pleased, have filled a dozen
quartos; and, as he himself confesses, he
found the task of omission heavier than
that of collection. Let us add, that he
has omitted well, and that he has seasoned
a pleasant and instructive history with the
very concentrated essence of agreeable
gossip."</p>

<p>H<span class="smcap">ERALD</span>.&mdash;"Mr. Edwards has here produced
a work which ought to command a
great sale, if its merits and the great
number of opera-goers may be considered.
Completely master of his subject, and

Edwards in these volumes gives us an exceedingly
interesting history of operatic
performances."</p>

addition to the library of every lover
of the noble game of chess. Our author
makes a stout fight for the Hindoos as the
inventors of the game, and adduces many
cogent proofs in support of his opinion.
He shows how the game is played in other
countries, how it has been modified both in
the names of the pieces and the names of
the game by the peculiarities of the
country or the national temperament of
the inhabitants; and then traces the steps
by which it has arrived at its present place
of honour in civilized and intellectual
Europe. The book is, therefore, full of
curious lore, that lean on other and higher
subjects than chess-playing, for it involves
dissertations on ethnology, comparative
etymology, the dispersion and settlement
of nations, and the manners and customs
of different countries, to a degree that
would not be at all anticipated by a person
who contented himself by reading the
title-page. All this information is given,
not in any dry, repulsive, or even technical

<div class="indexcol">
<p>F<span class="smcap">IELD</span>, <em>July</em> 28, 1863.&mdash;"The book contains
nearly 600 pages of valuable matter,
which reflects great credit on its author,
and, owing to its practical details, the
result of deep scientific research, deserves
a place in the library of medical, veterinary,
and non-professional readers."</p>

<p>A<span class="smcap">THENÆUM</span>, <em>August</em> 4, 1860.&mdash;"Mr.
Mayhew has written several works on the
diseases, with details of the anatomy, of
animals. His accuracy is great. The
chapters are well arranged. Each speaks
of the diseases of one part of the equine
frame. The illustrations to these are excellent.
The operations are accurately
described; not the slightest useful hint is
forgotten; while to render this portion
more intelligible, diagrams of the parts to
be operated on, with views of the instruments,
are generally given; and the prescriptions,
as stated in the title-page, are
made out in English. The causes,
symptoms, and treatment of diseases are
briefly recorded in a summary, forming an
appendix. We conclude by commending
Mr. Mayhew's book, especially to every
possessor of the most useful of the 'servants
of man.'"</p>

<p>I<span class="smcap">LLUSTRATED</span> N<span class="smcap">EWS</span>.&mdash;"The great mass
of the illustrations are wonderfully faithful,
and they are so varied and interesting
that we would undertake to get rid of the
most confirmed bore that ever pressed
heavily on mankind for a good two hours
by only handing him the book, and directing
his attention to them. It is a well-known
fact that grooms only remember
the names of four or five diseases, and are
sadly indiscriminate in their knowledge of
symptoms. This book furnishes at once
the bane and the antidote, as the drawings
show the horse not only suffering from
every kind of disease, but in the different
stages of it, while the alphabetical summary
at the end gives the cause, symptoms,
and treatment of each."</p>

<p>G<span class="smcap">LOBE.</span>&mdash;"Every gentleman who possesses
or cares for horses, would do well to
keep this book in his house."</p>

<p>E<span class="smcap">RA.</span>&mdash;"We advisedly say that 'The
Illustrated Horse Doctor' is the very best
book of the kind which we know; and
what gives it an especial charm is, that the
author so thoroughly sympathises with the
noble animal which he describes. Without
pretending to go into any analysis of this
valuable work, we at once pronounce it as
scientific, yet intelligible; informing, yet
highly amusing; acceptable to the profound
horse-doctor, yet the work of all
others for the bookshelves in every gentleman's
sanctum."</p>

<p>A<span class="smcap">RMY AND</span> N<span class="smcap">AVY</span> G<span class="smcap">AZETTE</span>.&mdash;"Mr.
Mayhew's volume will, we imagine, meet
with a hearty welcome. It is just such a
good practical work on the Veterinary Art
as most of us horse-using (and not unfrequently,
we fear, abusing) Englishmen
have long felt the need of.&mdash;We must not
conclude our remarks without commenting
on the numerous wood-cuts with which the
volume is embellished. It is truly, as it
professes to be, an '<em>Illustrated Horse
Doctor</em>.'"</p>

<p>I<span class="smcap">LLUSTRATED</span> T<span class="smcap">IMES</span>.&mdash;"Many years ago
the writer of these lines was incidentally
'read up' in horse literature, and a good
deal in the way of sporting people. His
reading and observation in that way have
been very pleasantly recalled by this <em>model</em>
book. We need not waste words about this
admirable volume&mdash;manual, we were going
to say, but it is more of an armful than a
handful. It is quite beyond praise of ours
in its completeness and general excellence,
concerned as it is our lot to be with the
study instead of the steed. But we showed
it to a friend of ours (living at Horsely-down),
who spends his mornings at Tattersall's
and his afternoons at the Alhambra,
and his evenings at Astley's, and his criticism
was conveyed in these emphatic
words. 'Sir,' said he (his name is Ryder),
'it is the Buchan's Domestic Medicine of
the stable; the mantle of Bucephalus has
fallen upon Mr. Mayhew.' Every way
the work is interesting, and it is beautifully
got up; the paper and print being the best
we have seen for some time."</p>

<p class="p2a">CRITICAL NOTICES.</p>

<div class="indexcol">
<p>A<span class="smcap">THENÆUM</span>, <em>Feb.</em> 20, 1864.&mdash;"Mr. Mayhew
thoroughly comprehends the matter,
and all masters of studs&mdash;we may say,
every owner of a single pony or ass&mdash;will
derive much profit and an equal amount of
pleasure by perusing this volume; for the
book is not only distinguished by common
sense, but by its power of amusing. We
never met with a volume which more
honestly and efficiently carried out the
promise made on its title-page. A large
amount of English life, ways, manners,
morals, dodges and doings is described by
Mr. Mayhew, as well as more serious
matter connected with the question which
he so ably handles."</p>

<p>S<span class="smcap">TANDARD</span>, <em>Jan.</em> 27, 1864.&mdash;"It is, perhaps,
the most perfect work yet published
upon the management of horses. Everywhere
Mr. Mayhew writes ably and
readably, and with neither fear nor favour;
his observations always commend themselves
to one's understanding, and he hits
fairly many blots in our present system of
management. The engravings are exceedingly
well executed, and they illustrate the
text actually as well as nominally."</p>

<p>O<span class="smcap">BSERVER</span>, <em>Jan.</em> 10, 1864.&mdash;"Mr. Mayhew
is already favourably known to a large
number of persons interested in the
management of horses by a former work,
with the title of the 'Illustrated Horse
Doctor,' and the volume under notice will
certainly add considerably to his reputation
for extensive knowledge and thorough
acquaintance with the subject with which
he professes to deal. Mr. Mayhew also has
some very useful remarks on the situation,
nature and value of the various points to
be looked for by the purchaser of a horse,
and this useful information is supplemented
by some very excellent and truthful remarks
upon grooms, dealers, breeders,
breakers and trainers, the whole forming a
most valuable work for guidance and reference,
and displaying in every page an
earnest desire to improve the condition and
treatment of one of the noblest and most
serviceable animals provided for the use of
man."</p>

<p>S<span class="smcap">PECTATOR</span>, <em>Feb.</em> 6, 1864.&mdash;"No horseman
who can afford to buy it will regret
the purchase of Mr. Mayhew's 'Illustrated
Horse Management.'"</p>

<p>B<span class="smcap">ELL'S</span> M<span class="smcap">ESSENGER</span>.&mdash;"There can be no
question that Mr. Mayhew is the most competent
man of the day for the task which
he has undertaken, and we must add most
satisfactorily accomplished. 'The Illustrated
Horse Management' may be fitly
termed an encyclopædia of all that relates
to the horse, and the several uses to which
it can be applied. We, therefore, earnestly
recommend this handsome volume to our
readers, with the conviction that every one
who cares for his horse can profitably and
pleasurably consult its well-stored pages."</p>

<p>S<span class="smcap">UN</span>, <em>Jan.</em> 19, 1864.&mdash;"We have read Mr.
Mayhew's book with all the attention
which it so eminently merits, and we have
no hesitation in asserting that it is the most
comprehensive and instructive work on the
subject of horse management which we
have ever had the luck to meet with. The
'Illustrated Horse Management' is a
work which should find a place in the
library of every country gentleman, for
the most experienced may derive benefit
from its perusal."</p>

<p>N<span class="smcap">ONCONFORMIST</span>, <em>March</em> 9, 1864.&mdash;"Grooms
hate their masters to be too
knowing, but whoever shall quietly study
this book, and make it his guide for a few
weeks in the observation and control of his
own stable, will not afterwards feel himself
to be dependent on his servants. Mr. Mayhew
writes clearly, forcibly, and delightfully,
and we earnestly recommend his
book to every one who is the owner of
even a pony for his children's use, while
those who have extensive stables should
read and read again every paragraph of
its closely packed contents."</p>

<p>G<span class="smcap">LOBE</span>, <em>Feb.</em> 22, 1864.&mdash;"Mr. Mayhew
writes on a subject of which he is master;
and his new book is a work of care, experience
and general enlightenment, as concerns
the management of horses."</p>

<p>E<span class="smcap">CONOMIST</span>, <em>March</em> 5, 1864.&mdash;"The 'Illustrated
Horse Management,' by Edward
Mayhew, is really a very useful book to all
who are concerned with horses, either for
pleasure or profit. To English farmers,
who may be induced to breed horses, the
various points of management which are
insisted on by Mr. Mayhew in ample detail
have a money value."</p>

that held by M. Brandt the elder, was situated in the southernmost province of
the kingdom, and near Hamburg. This remote province, consequently, suited
him better than any other, and what he solicited as an exile, and to some extent
as the equivalent of a capital punishment, would have been to any other person
a very considerable recompense, and the end desired by some old servant of the

this charge against Struensee also removed from office persons who displeased
them, and even deprived them of their liberty and property. What I personally
experienced certainly places me in the position to judge.&mdash;<cite>Falckenskjold</cite>,

to the violent assault by the Swedes on the night of February 11, 1659,
which was repulsed by the citizens, and to the conduct of the Copenhageners
at the Diet of 1660, when the sovereignty was handed over to Frederick III.,

was frequently alone, and I saw him arrive thus at Gripsholm. It was after the
fall of Struensee that the king, being closely watched, was only accessible as
far as pleased the dominant party.&mdash;<cite>Falckenskjold</cite>, p. 205.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> I may remark that Struensee had a salary of 1,500 crowns as secretary to
the cabinet; that he afterwards had 3,000 in his quality of councillor; that he
lived inexpensively and dressed plainly; that only a few days before his fall he
set up his carriage, the magnificence of which was imputed as a crime&mdash;it
was a carriage in the English style, without gilding or painting, lined with
straw-coloured cloth. Guldberg, who charged him with avidity, afterwards
thought proper to accept a gratification of 100,000 crowns in one sum, by a
note signed by the king.&mdash;<cite>Falckenskjold</cite>, p. 208.</p></div>

not have compared a small present made to the queen with what the king gave
to simple private persons without fortune, whom he had summoned and
admitted to his familiarity. They would not have pretended to be ignorant
why Struensee wrote the accounts of May, 1771, and did not write the following
accounts when he had ceased to be cabinet secretary.&mdash;<cite>Falckenskjold</cite>, p. 206.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Struensee had no more power on this account than when he was merely
master of requests and private secretary to the king. The great reforms were
effected while he occupied those two posts. Besides, according to the royal
law, "the king can appoint any minister under such title and with such
power as he pleases." It was no contravention of the law to accept an office
which the king could give and revoke at his pleasure; but, with such a law as
that of Denmark, weight may be attached to any sort of accusation. Count de
St. Germain was accused of infringing the royal law, because he proposed to
raze the useless fortresses and dress the army in blue. The first Bernstorff
was also accused of contravention of the <cite>Lex Regia</cite> when he was dismissed.
The persons who condemned Struensee to death for having encroached on the
absolute power of the king, issued the following decree on February 13, 1772,
or while the trial was going on:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"All orders shall be drawn up by the council and through the council. No
order given directly by the king shall be carried into effect, unless the bearer
of it has made application to the department which it concerns, and this
department has acknowledged the said order."&mdash;<cite>Falckenskjold</cite>, p. 208.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> It was, on the contrary, Struensee's principle to purge the army and civil
service of foreigners, and only to leave natives; the reform had already been
effected in this way in the regiment of Seeland Dragoons. Braëm, one of the
commissioners to try Struensee, was well aware of this, as he was a member of
the War Department.&mdash;<cite>Falckenskjold</cite>, p. 209.</p></div>

accused of having issued without the king's privity. The War Department,
of which I was a member, received on December 21 the Minutes of this order
for the disbandment of the Foot Guards; it made no protest; it did not ask
that the minute should be signed by the king, which was not necessary; the
patent was immediately drawn up, and addressed, according to custom, to the
king, that it might receive his signature and seal; the king signed this patent
on December 23; such is the exact truth. How could it be stated in the
sentence that the king had no cognizance on December 21 of a minute the
patent of which he ratified on the 23rd by his signature? How could he be
ignorant on December 24 of an order he had signed on the 23rd?&mdash;<cite>Falckenskjold</cite>,

<p><a name="Footnote_42_42" id="Footnote_42_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> The following interesting account, which I have found in a pamphlet
published under the title of "Sittliche Frage," was not sufficiently authenticated
to be embodied in my text. Still I do not think it should be passed over,
as it affords an idea of the sentiments of the queen's party.</p>

<p>Keith laid before the king the letter of separation for his signature, which
the king was about to sign without reading. "No, no, your Majesty," the envoy
said, "read it first. It concerns you. It is the separation between yourself
and your consort, which the court of England solicits for the reasons given."
The king cried in confusion, "What! I am to lose my wife? State it even in
writing? No, I cannot. I love and long for her again. Where are Struensee
and Brandt? I long for them too." "Your Majesty," Keith replied, "they
have been quartered, your Majesty signed their sentences yourself, and as it is
also wished to condemn the queen to death, my court demands her back." The
king became inconsolable. He asked for the queen and his two counts, and
dismissed the envoy.</p>

<p>That England imposed weighty points on the Danish court, and demanded
all possible satisfaction for the trick played the queen regnant, is evident from
the following facts:&mdash;The queen is still called Queen of Denmark, even by the
Danish court; her children by the king are brought up royally, and called the
crown prince of the Danish kingdom and the king's daughter. When she
set out from Kronborg for Celle, all royal honours were granted (which could
not have been the case had the fabulous intercourse been true), and a pension
of 30,000 rix-dollars is to be paid her annually.</p>

<p>The king now lives very sadly, and his days pass away in melancholy. He
still exclaims, "My wife, my wife! she has been torn from me. I ask for her
again. My ministers, my Struensee and Brandt, where are they? They have
been condemned to death. They have passed over into eternity, and I am
left desolate."</p></div>

have also suffered from this iniquitous system. My agent in Germany wrote
me some months ago that he had made an invaluable <em>trouvaille</em>&mdash;no less than
an apology for Caroline Matilda, written by herself. Of course, I at once secured
it; but was rather disappointed to find that it was translated from the
English. On reading, I found many discrepancies, but did not give up all hope
of being able to make use of the pamphlet. I had the British Museum searched
for the original, but in vain; and I began to think that the alleged translation
was only intended to add value to a document which might have been drawn up
by a German from expressions which had fallen from the queen. Imagine my
disgust when, as the reward of all my trouble, I found in the list of pamphlets
in the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for 1772, the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Queen of Denmark's own Account of the late Revolution in Denmark:
Written while her Majesty was a Prisoner in the Castle of Cronenburgh, and now
first published from the Original Manuscript sent to a noble Earl." 8vo., 1s. 6d.

pamphlet issued from the great <em>officina</em> of Grub Street.</p></div>

point on devoit être touché et pénétré d'admiration, en voyant que ce n'étoit

and a MS. entitled an "Historical Narrative of the Attempt to Restore the

proposition:&mdash;"A momentary astonishment covered me, but it neither altered
my cheek nor faltered on my tongue. I felt in the most unbounded degree
where it might lead. I was conscious where it must lead. I felt myself born
for the achievement, and I ardently embraced it. 'Yes,' <em>I</em> said in reply, 'I am
the man you seek; give me the commission; I am ready in a day, an hour, a
minute. My life, my labour,&mdash;dispose of them as your own. Enthusiasm I
shall not want in such a cause so noble, so honourable to me.' 'It is well,' he
said. 'I am satisfied; wait till this evening, or, at latest, to-morrow. You
shall see and talk with this person. At the Comédie Française we meet this
night. Adieu.'"</p></div>

most unreservedly, more than an hour. Her graciousness and goodness knew
no bounds. She described (as to an equal) the king, and her sister, the Princess
of Brunswick, especially the last. Her dress was very simple and plain. It could
scarce be more so." From the minutes of this conversation, I also find that the
queen told my grandfather that three emissaries had reached her from Copenhagen.
The first was a Dane of the name of Guldenstern, about a year and a
half previously; the second mentioned the name of Count Holstein; he was
a musician, and named some of the bourgeoisie, whom she had never heard of.
The third came about a year before, but his communication was nothing.</p></div>

business, our discourse took another turn, and fell on the Danish affairs. The
baron gave me a most interesting and masterly account of Struensee's administration,
his character, and his history. He explained the manner in which he
acquired his Majesty's graces, and how he kept possession of them. He gave
me the relation of the plot for massacring them all at the "<em>B&oelig;uf roti</em>," and
how they escaped it. He passed to the fatal night when the two counts were
arrested, and the wonderful incident of the tea-party, which Madame de
Schimmelmann broke off by her refusal. He ended with his own arrest and
honorary exile. 'Twas a relation to listen to; and I devoured his words.

1781, or when Mr. Wraxall had a seat in the House of Commons, and a useful
vote, that Lord North brought up the subject. My grandfather then received
1,000 guineas for his services, and the promise of a seat at the Board of
Green Cloth. The promise was not kept; for what reason he shall tell us
himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In November, 1783, on the meeting of Parliament, the memorable East
India Bill was introduced by Mr. Fox. Upon the first division that took
place on the bill, I quitted Lord North, notwithstanding the motives I had to
adhere to him; rather choosing to abandon my expectations, however near
their accomplishment, than give my support to a measure which I considered
to be pregnant with mischief to the country and constitution. I joined Mr.
Pitt in opposition, and was one of the one hundred and twenty members who
formed the minority on that evening against a majority of two hundred and
twenty-nine in favour of the bill."</p></div>

only person in the Danish ministry who ventured in any degree to oppose
the French and Prussian policy, his dismissal was resolved on in the cabinets

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
